## Description of changes

[eg., "This PR clarifies the WebSDK docs, explaining how the Severity Score is calculated"]

## Checklist before you pull:

- [ ] Double-check that any changes fit the [Embrace Docs Style Guide](https://embrace.io/docs/embrace-docs-style-guide/).
- [ ] Please ensure that there is no customer-identifying information in text or images.
- [ ] If you changed any doc file names, add a redirect from old to new URL so that we don't end up with broken links. You can do this by adding a set of to/from values in `docusaurus.config.js` under `@docusaurus/plugin-client-redirects`.
- [ ] If you link to a header within a page in the docs, make sure that header has an explicit tag in case it changes in the future. E.g., the H3 header `### Hello World {#my-explicit-id}` has an explicit tag `my-explicit-id`.
