## Checklist before you pull:

- [ ] Double-check that any changes fit the [Embrace Docs Style Guide](https://embraceio.notion.site/Embrace-Public-Docs-Style-Guide-19f7e3c99852804abd7deacc2b14cc14).
- [ ] Please ensure that there is no customer-identifying information in text or images.
- [ ] Please ensure there is no consumer PII in text or images.
- [ ] If you renamed any pages then perhaps you likely want to add a redirect from old to new URL so that we don't end up with broken links. You can do this by adding a pair of to/from values in `docusaurus.config.js` under `@docusaurus/plugin-client-redirects`
