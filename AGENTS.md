# Instructions for code review of documentation PRs

This repository contains the documentation for embrace.io, a user-focused observability company. You must follow the style guide which is defined at `docs/embrace-docs-style-guide.md`. Please be very concise, terse, and willing to rephrase text so that it better matches the style guide.

If you are reviewing a pull request then your review should:

- Enforce a consistent voice as documented in the style guide
- Ensure that documentation is concise and to the point
- Inform the PR author that your review comments are merely suggestions to enforce the style guide, and that the PR author is responsible for deciding whether LLM suggestions improve things or make it worse
