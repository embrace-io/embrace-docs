# Enrich your sessions with Breadcrumb

## Adding Relevant Information to Sessions

Embrace can collect basic session data and crashes as you've already seen in the [Crash Reporting](/android/integration/crash-reporting/) and [Session Reporting](/android/integration/session-reporting/) sections.
Embrace can also collect your logging data and include it as relevant information and details to enrich your sessions.

Here's how you add a Breadcrumb to the session:
```kotlin
Embrace.getInstance().addBreadcrumb("onDragEvent called, starting drag")
```

In the above example, a Breadcrumb is being logged when a drag event listener is called.
This event is not otherwise shown in the session and can be important depending on what the user does next.

:::warning Important
Breadcrumb messages must be 256 characters or less.

We generally use the Breadcrumb method for our logging and not the Log Message API to add relevant information to sessions.
Breadcrumbs are a lightweight way to add logging to your session. They add no CPU or memory overhead, and trigger no networking calls.
The Log Message API is a much heavier mechanism. We will learn about it in the [Alerting](/android/integration/log-message-api/) section of the documentation.
For now, just know that using Breadcrumbs is the right thing to do most of the time.
