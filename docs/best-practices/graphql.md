# Monitoring GraphQL Requests

Generally, network requests made to a REST API each hit its own unique endpoint.
From a monitoring perspective, this is helpful because developers can clearly
see rolled up network metrics by path.

GraphQL is a bit different in that each request hits the same `/graphql` endpoint.
Thus, it can be difficult to monitor requests that may perform different
actions.

Here we will show you how to configure your integration so you see different
GraphQL requests broken out by "path" in the Dashboard.

## Override Paths of Requests

It's possible to override the path of a network request that the Embrace SDK. iOS 5.X and Android
allows this override by setting the `x-emb-path` header on the request. For example, if your network request is made
to `https://example.com/graphql`, and you set the `x-emb-path` header to `/graphql/friends_list`, the request will
be reported as `https://example.com/graphql/friends_list`.

In iOS 6.X, you can hook into a callback that lets you modify the captured request directly.

:::warning Important
**The x-emb-path value must meet the following requirements or it will be ignored.**

* Must be a string with a length in the range from 1 to 1024 characters
* Must start with a /
* Must only contain ASCII characters
