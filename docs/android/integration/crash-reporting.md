# Collect Your First Crash Report

##  Setting up the Crash Reporter

:::info
See our [FAQ](/android/faq#crashes-and-anrs) for details on compatibility with other crash reporters.
:::

The Embrace SDK will automatically capture crash reports, assuming you've initialized the Embrace SDK in the [Session Reporting](/android/integration/session-reporting/) guide.

You can test this out by triggering a crash:

```kotlin
throw RuntimeException("This is a crash")
```

:::danger
This will crash your app, so only use it for testing purposes.
:::

In most scenarios, the Embrace SDK is able to upload a crash report and session message after a crash occurs, but for certain scenarios they can only be uploaded on the next launch. If you do not see your crash in the dashboard, relaunch your application.

Once the crash and session messages are uploaded, you should notice that your session is marked with the "crashed" icon and your crash is visible in the crashes section of the dashboard.

## Symbolicating Stack Traces

If you have obfuscated your application with ProGuard, DexGuard, R8, or another obfuscation tool, the captured crashes will contain obfuscated method names. ProGuard, DexGuard and R8 files will be uploaded automatically at build time. If you don't see symbolicated crashes while using ProGuard, DexGuard or R8, reach out to us on Slack and we'll work with you directly.

:::note
DexGuard is supported without any specific configuration required.
