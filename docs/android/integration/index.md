# Android Integration

## Getting started

This section provides instructions for integrating Embrace's Android SDK into your app. Our minimum supported
versions can be found [here](/android/versioning/).

After completing an SDK integration we recommend you read the [SDK configuration](/android/features/) and
[Gradle Plugin configuration](/android/features/embrace-gradle-plugin/). Tweaking behavior beyond the defaults will help you
get maximum value from the product.
