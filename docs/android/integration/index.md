# Android Integration

## Getting Started

We'll be guiding you through integrating Embrace into your Android application
with a series of articles. We recommend going through them in order, although
you are free to skip around.

## Requirements

Embrace has the following minimum requirements on Android at build time:

- Java 11
- Android SDK Platform 34
- Kotlin 1.8.22

If the minimum Android version your app supports at runtime is 8.0 (API 26):

- Gradle 7.5.1
- AGP (Android Gradle Build Tools Plugin) 7.4.2

If the minimum Android is less than 8.0:

- Gradle 8.4
- AGP 8.3.0

At runtime, Android 5.0 (API 21) and later are supported.
