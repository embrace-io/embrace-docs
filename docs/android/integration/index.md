# Android Integration

## Getting Started

We'll be guiding you through integrating Embrace into your Android application
with a series of articles. We recommend going through them in order, although
you are free to skip around.

## Requirements

Embrace has the following minimum requirements on Android at build time:

* Java 11
* Android SDK Platform 34
* Kotlin 1.8.22

If the minimum Android version your app supports at runtime is 8.0 (API 26):

* Gradle 7.5.1
* AGP (Android Gradle Build Tools Plugin) 7.4.2

If the minimum Android is less than 8.0:

* Gradle 8.4
* AGP 8.3.0

At runtime, Android 5.0 (API 21) and later are supported.
