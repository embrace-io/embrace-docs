# Android Platform Documentation

## Getting Started

This documentation is split into two sections:

1. [**Integration Guide**](/android/integration/)
2. [**Feature Reference**](/android/features/)

If you are just starting out with Embrace, follow the [**Integration Guide**](/android/integration/) to learn
the key steps to successfully using our product.

Once you've completed that, browse through our [**Feature Reference**](/android/features/) guides to learn how
to use some of the advanced features our SDK provides.

You can also view our [FAQ](/android/faq/) and [Changelog](/android/changelog/)
