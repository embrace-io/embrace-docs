# Next Steps

## Wrapping Up

Congratulations on completing the Android integration guide!  

If you found anything confusing or have suggestions on improving the docs,
please don't hesitate to reach out to us at [support@embrace.io](mailto:support@embrace.io) or on Slack.

## Feature Reference

Embrace includes many optional advanced features that can help you figure out some of  
the most challenging issues. Learn about these features, and how to enable them, in
our [Feature Reference](/android/features/).

## Sample Integration Apps

For a sample integration, or to check out how you can use more advanced features of the SDK, take a look at the example app in the <a href="https://github.com/embrace-io/embrace-android-sdk/tree/main/examples/" target="_blank">Embrace Android SDK repo</a> on GitHub.

## API Docs

To see the full list of methods that the Android Embrace SDK exposes, please see the [Android API docs](/api/android/).

## Configuration

The SDK and associated Gradle plugin have configuration options that we have not explored during the onboarding.
Explore the options available on the [SDK Configuration](/android/configuration/configuration-file/) page to see if any are useful to you in your
application.

## Check Out the FAQ

See a list of frequently asked questions on the [FAQ](/android/faq/) page.

## Best Practices

We offer further guides in the [Best Practices](/best-practices/) section of the docs.
Be sure to check these out, as they'll help you make decisions that will allow you to make the most of Embrace.
