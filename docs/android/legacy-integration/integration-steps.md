# Integration Steps

1. [**Login to the Embrace dashboard.**](/android/legacy-integration/login-embrace-dashboard) Your data is available in the dashboard. It is important that you have this open while working on the integration to monitor progress.
2. [**Adding the Embrace SDK.**](/android/legacy-integration/add-embrace-sdk) We'll be adding the Embrace SDK to your project
   with Gradle.
3. [**Create your first session.**](/android/legacy-integration/session-reporting) You'll launch your app after you've
   initialized Embrace, and be able to see your first session in the Embrace
   Dashboard.
4. [**Collect your first crash report.**](/android/legacy-integration/crash-reporting) Generate a crash and see the report that
   gets uploaded.
5. [**Add a breadcrumb.**](/android/legacy-integration/breadcrumbs) Log messages using the Embrace SDK.
6. [**Add alerts.**](/android/legacy-integration/log-message-api) Use Embrace's log events to power a real-time alerting system so you can rest easy knowing we will tell you if your application breaks.
