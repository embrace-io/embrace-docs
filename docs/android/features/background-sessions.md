# Capture background sessions

The Embrace SDK can be configured to enable the capturing of background sessions. You can enable and disable capturing background sessions on the settings page of the Embrace dashboard.

The SDK receives the configuration via Embrace's server and this can take some time to propagate if you wish to enable/disable capturing background sessions.

:::info
Capturing background sessions requires v5.10.0 or higher.

:::warning Important
Enabling the collection of background sessions will increase the amount of sessions that are collected.
