# Capture Background Sessions

The Embrace SDK can be configured to enable the capturing of background sessions. You can enable and disable capturing background sessions on the settings page of the Embrace dashboard.

Itâ€™s a server side configuration that gets received by the clients, and as it propagates they will stop sending the data.
