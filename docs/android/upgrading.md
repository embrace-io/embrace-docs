## Moments have been superseded by Traces

[Traces](/docs/android/features/traces.md) serve the same purposes as [Moments](/docs/android/features/moments.md), with greatly enhanced capabilities. Built on [OTel Spans](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/traces/), Traces capture end-to-end journeys made of multiple spans. Traces can contain many spans as "children", as well as attributes and events that offer flexibility on the client and numerous aggregation options on the backend. This instrumentation allows you trace an entire process by breaking it down into smaller units of work.

A span is simply an operation occurring over a period of time. Using spans, you can track how long operations within the app take, and more. Note that, in building on existing OTel APIs, the Embrace Android SDK does not have instrumentation for an object called a "trace". Instead, a trace is the root span for a given workflow.

### Sample usage

Here is an example of how spans and traces replace and enhance the existing Moment feature:

```mdx-code-block
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
```

<Tabs groupId="android-language" queryString="android-language">
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">
```kotlin
val span = Embrace.getInstance().startSpan("my-identifier") // start span
// add events and attributes to span
span?.stop() // stop span
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

For more detail on the additional things you can do with spans please see the [Traces](/docs/android/features/traces.md) documentation.

## Remove deprecated properties from your build.gradle

These 5 deprecated properties have been removed from our Gradle plugin. Please remove them from your `app/build.gradle` file.

```groovy
swazzler {
    ...
    forceOkHttpWrapperInjection = true/false
    forceFcmWrapperInjection = true/false
    useNewDependencyInstaller = true/false
    forceVolleyWrapperInjection = true/false
    instrumentVolley = true/false
    ...
}
```

## Replace usage of deprecated methods with new ones

Version 6.0.0 of the Embrace Android SDK removed some methods that had been deprecated in 5.x. The renamed methods were removed to reduce confusion and increase consistency across the Embrace SDKs on various platforms, and their replacements behave the same way as the old ones. The methods removed entirely are for functionality that we no longer support. If you were using them for a specific use-case, please speak to us about how you can use the existing APIs instead.

## Only use OkHttp versions that are at least 4.0.0

With the minimum API version being 21 (Android 5.0), version 4.0.0 of OkHttp is now the recommended minimum for use at runtime. While support for OkHttp 3.13.0+ was added in SDK version 6.3.2, it is not recommended, as newer versions are more performant. See the [changelog for 6.0.0](/android/changelog/#600) for details about the other new minimum requirements.
