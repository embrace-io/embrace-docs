# Android SDK Changelog

## 6.14.0
*October 31, 2024*

- Extensive improvements to the resiliency and performance of telemetry persistence and delivery, especially under adverse device and network conditions.
- Fixed issue where feature flags were not being cached and applied consistently.
- New runtime dependency: OkHttp 4.12.
    - See the FAQ [here](/android/faq/#how-do-i-override-the-version-of-okhttp-to-be-lower-than-the-one-embrace-specifies) if you want to use a lower version at runtime (not recommend or supported).


## 6.13.0
*September 12, 2024*

- Improve SDK startup performance.
- Fix issue with capturing details of network requests with long URLs.
- Increase default ANR call stack depth to 200 frames.

## 6.12.2
*September 11, 2024*

- Fix race condition on app startup when native crash capture is enabled that could result in a crash when the native delegate is accessed before the library is loaded

## 6.12.1
*September 6, 2024*

- Fix JVM crash recording and Embrace API request retries when Embrace enums are obfuscated.
- Improve delivery retry of sessions ended by a native crash or background process termination.

## 6.12.0
*September 5, 2024*

:::info Important
This version contains a bug where obfuscating Embrace classes will lead to JVM crashes not being recorded and failed requests to Embrace not being retried after that app process terminates.

*This version should not be used*, but you can workaround this by adding the following keep rule to your Proguard file so R8 will bypass obfuscation for the matched code: 

`-keep class io.embrace.android.embracesdk.** { *; }`
:::

- Improve SDK startup performance.
- Increase resilience of telemetry delivery under poor network conditions.
- Add configuration to redact values for custom property keys on a denylist.
- Fix bug at build time that invalidated the Gradle configuration cache when the native crash capture feature was disabled.

## 6.11.0
*August 27, 2024*

- Update cached background activities when session properties are modified.
- Apply configuration defined in `embrace-config.json` properly if appId is not specified (Fix for #1219).
- Restore access via synthetic properties in Kotlin for `getDeviceId()` and `getLastRunEndState()` (Fix for #1253).
- Update OpenTelemetry Java SDK and BoM to 1.41.0.

## 6.10.0
*August 13, 2024*

- Support Android 15 and devices that use 16KB native page size.
- Updated minimum requirements to the following:
    - JDK 11
    - Android SDK Platform 34
    - Gradle 7.5.1
    - AGP 7.4.2
    - Kotlin 1.8.22
- Improve R8 ruleset to further reduce the size of the SDK binary.
- Upload native symbols by default during the build process unless explicitly disabled.
- Split main SDK module (`io.embrace.embrace-android-sdk`) into several modules.
    - This is an internal change and has no direct user impact. App dependencies on Embrace remain unchanged.
- `Embrace.getDeviceId()` and `Embrace.getLastEndState()` only accessible as functions but not as properties in Kotlin.

## 6.9.2
*August 1, 2024*
- Fix session recording after app backgrounding if Background Activity is disabled.

:::warning Important
Version 6.9.0 and 6.9.1 have an issue recording sessions after an app backgrounds if Background Activity is disabled. 

Do not use these versions of the SDK. This issue has been addressed in 6.9.2.
:::

## 6.9.1
*July 10, 2024*
- Fix the SDK version sent in session payloads

## 6.9.0
*July 4, 2024*
- OpenTelemetry compatibility improvements:
    - Provide implementation of the [OpenTelemetry Tracing API](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/trace/api/). 
        - Spans recorded through this API and implementation are equivalent to those recorded using the Embrace Traces API. 
        - This can be obtained through the `getOpenTelemetry()` method, which will return working implementations for methods involving tracing. Methods involving Logs and Metrics are no-ops at the current time.
    - Stopping spans through the Embrace Traces API no longer implicitly sets Status to `OK`.
    - Add `telemetry.distro.*` resource attributes to exported signals.
    - Update OpenTelemetry SDK dependency to version 1.38 of the [OpenTelemetry BOM](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java?tab=readme-ov-file#bill-of-material).
    - Consume semantic conventions from [OTel Semantic Conventions for Java](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions-java).
- Enhance Traces API to support behavior exposed via the OpenTelemetry Tracing API.
- Change internal endpoint to which session data is sent (no user-facing behavior changes).
- Issue build warning for apps that have minSdk < 24 and are using AGP < 8.3.
    - If minSdk is lower than 24 (i.e. Android 5 and/or 6 is supported by the app), AGP version 8.3+ must be used so the app can be desugared with the proper setting.
    - See [this question](/android/faq/#the-sdk-should-support-api-level-21-but-i-get-an-error-saying-i-need-to-set-androidusefullclasspathfordexingtransformapi) in the FAQ for details.
- Fix DexGuard support.

## 6.8.3
*July 17, 2024*
- No change to functionality. Remove error log integration verification explicitly for apps that don't use R8 to strip out unreferenced classes.

## 6.8.2
*June 7, 2024*
- Remove dependency on the configuration attribute `enable_automatic_activity_capture` for manually capturing views

## 6.8.1
*June 4, 2024*
- Fix a build error while reading the api_token from an environment variable.

## 6.8.0
*May 28, 2024*
- Complete migration to OpenTelemetry, which means all app data recorded by the SDK can be sent directly to OpenTelemetry Collectors from the app.
- Allow the SDK to be used without being an Embrace customer, so data is only sent to OpenTelemetry Collectors and not to Embrace.
- Verify as part of the build that desugaring is enabled for apps supporting Android versions less than 7.0 (i.e. `minSdkVerion` < 24).
- Fix the location we look for flavor-specific Embrace configuration files during the build.
- Remove excessive SDK logging.


## 6.7.0
*April 22, 2024*
 - Support configuration of OpenTelemetry Exporters to export [Logs](/android/integration/log-message-api/#export-your-telemetry) data as OpenTelemetry LogRecord.

## 6.6.0
*April 19, 2024*

:::info Important
API Desugaring is now a requirement for apps that support Android 5 and 6. This is a simple, well-supported process done by Android build tooling that backports certain Java 8 language features onto older Android versions that didn't have support. For more information, please see [Google's documentation here](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/java8-support#library-desugaring)
:::

- THE [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) Release! The Embrace Android SDK now uses the OpenTelemetry Java SDK at its core.
- This means the bulk of the telemetry is recorded as OTel signals, so they can be sent directly to OTel Collectors from the app using any Java OTLP Exporter that is compatible with Android. Telemetry types modeled by Embrace like sessions, crashes, ANRs, and logs have canonical representations as OTel signals using a combination of OTel and in-house semantic conventions.
- The number of Embrace conventions will hopefully shrink going forward as the community comes together around a set of shared semantic conventions to standardize the world of mobile telemetry. We will build upon this new foundation in the coming releases to bring together the worlds of OpenTelemetry, mobile client performance observability, and RUM!

## 6.5.0
*March 14, 2024*
:::info Important
- Increase our minimum Gradle version to 6.5.1
:::
- Fully support configuration cache on all Gradle versions.
- Fix issue with active Moments being lost when a new session starts.

## 6.4.0
*March 6, 2024*
- Traces improvements
    - Support configuration of OpenTelemetry Exporters to export [Traces](/android/features/traces/#export-to-opentelemetry-collectors) data as OpenTelemetry Spans (beta).
    - Change timestamps parameters of the APIs to use milliseconds to better align with Android developer expectations. 
        - Note: timestamps that are in nanoseconds will be detected and converted for now so existing instrumentation will still work, but this will be removed in an upcoming release.
    - Increase per-session limit of spans to 500 in total.
    - New methods added:
        - "getSpan" that returns a reference to an active or recently ended EmbraceSpan.
        - "startSpan" that creates and starts a span directly.
    - New functionality for existing methods:
        - Allow custom timestamps to be specified when starting and stopping a span.
        - Support adding attributes and span events to "recordSpan".
- Increase transparency of SDK startup by adding custom sections to traces recorded using Android system tracing libraries like androidx.tracing.
    - Note: only run Android system tracing on release builds running on real devices. Debug builds and emulators will not yield accurate data.
- Optimize React Native JavaScript bundleId retrieval to better support CodePush (React Native only)
- Allow configuration cache to be enabled for Gradle 8.3+
    - Note: for Gradle 8.3+, running Embrace Gradle plugin will invalidate the configuration cache 

## 6.3.2
*February 23, 2024*
- Improved performance and stability of NDK serialization while the app is under memory pressure
- Added back support of OkHttp 3.13.0+, which was initially removed in this major version

## 6.3.1
*February 2, 2024*

:::info Important
The [Configuration Cache](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/configuration_cache.html) feature for Gradle 8.4+ is not compatible with this release due to an [issue in Gradle tooling](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/19252). Please disable this in developer builds when used with this release or use an older version of Gradle.
:::

##  3.7.2
*November 7, 2019*

- Added a config setting to allow disabling of gunzipping of requests made with the native Android network request framework. By default the SDK handles the gunzipping to allow response size to be computed, but this can interfere with certain services.

##  3.7.1
*October 22, 2019*

- Handles attempt to set trace ID before SDK initialization
- Re-added removed `logNetworkCall` and `logNetworkClientError` methods

##  3.5.0
*August 9, 2019*

- We added support for passing a Throwable to logError. If you pass a Throwable, the stack trace from the Throwable will be used instead of the stack trace from where the logError method was called.
- Log messages are now limited to 128 characters. Contact us if you need longer log messages.
- We moved more of the work done for logInfo/Warning/Error calls to a worker thread to prevent the logging calls from blocking the threads they are called from.
- We set the timestamp for log messages immediately after the log method is called rather than in a worker thread. This should slightly improve the accuracy of the log timestamps.
- We reduced aggressiveness of config network requests. If you were offline and the SDK had never received a config, it would keep trying to get one more often than it should have.
- We added a method to get the Embrace-assigned device ID from the SDK.
- We now allow trace IDs to be captured from network requests and sent to Embrace.
- Gracefully handle multiple attempts to start the SDK
- Switched from using api to implementation for dependencies
- Added missing public event-related methods to match the iOS SDK

##  3.4.1
*July 22, 2019*

- Fixed typos in methods to set bytes in and out for manually-captured requests

##  3.4.0 
*July 22, 2019*

- Added support for manual capture of network requests. The SDK is capable of automatically capturing the majority of REST network calls made by applications, but this new method allows recording of network requests that are not automatically captured, such as gRPC requests.
