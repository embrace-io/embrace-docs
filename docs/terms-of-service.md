IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, DO NOT USE THE APPLICATION SERVICES. BY ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT BELOW OR BY USING THE APPLICATION SERVICES IN ANY MANNER, YOU, THE ENTITY YOU REPRESENT, AND ANY AFFILIATE OF SUCH ENTITY (COLLECTIVELY, “YOU” OR “CUSTOMER”) AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT TO THE EXCLUSION OF ALL OTHER TERMS. IF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT ARE CONSIDERED AN OFFER, ACCEPTANCE IS EXPRESSLY LIMITED TO SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS. THIS AGREEMENT IS ENTERED INTO AS OF THE DATE YOU FIRST ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT OR USE THE APPLICATION SERVICES (THE “EFFECTIVE DATE”).

## License to use the Services

Subject to the terms herein, Embrace grants to Customer a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free license to use the Application Services for Customer’s internal use and not for resale or further distribution. Customer’s right to use the Application Services is limited by all terms and conditions herein. Except for this license granted to Customer, Embrace and its licensors retain all right, title and interest in and to the Application Services, including all related intellectual property rights. The Application Services are protected by applicable intellectual property laws, including U.S. copyright law and international treaties. Customer may order the Application Services either through the online purchasing process at Embrace or a separate, written Order Form. An “Order Form” shall mean a document signed by both parties identifying the Application Services purchased by Customer and made available by Embrace pursuant to this Agreement, which such Order Form may only be modified by the written consent of both parties. An “Affiliate” means an entity which, directly or indirectly, owns or controls, is owned or is controlled by or is under common ownership or control with a party. As used herein, “control” means the power to direct the management or affairs of an entity, and “ownership” means the beneficial ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the voting equity securities or other equivalent voting interests of the entity.

Customer will not, and will not permit or authorize any third party to: (i) reproduce, modify, translate, enhance, decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer or create derivative works of any of the Application Services; (ii) rent, lease or sublicense access to any of the Application Services; or (iii) circumvent or disable any security or technological features of the Application Services.

Unless otherwise stated in an Order Form, all subscriptions to the Application Services auto-renew on an annual basis. Customer can terminate an auto-renewal by providing written notice to Embrace at support@Embrace.io at least sixty (60) days prior to the expiration of the then current subscription term period. Upon any renewal, the price of the applicable products/services may automatically increase by up to five percent (5%) unless otherwise agreed upon by Customer and Embrace in writing.

Fees paid hereunder are non-refundable and shall be billed in U.S. Dollars. Except as otherwise set forth in an Order Form, fees due hereunder will be billed to Customer’s credit card and Customer authorizes the card issuer to pay all such amounts and authorizes Embrace (or its billing agent) to charge the credit card account until Customer or Embrace cancels or terminates the Application Services as set forth herein; provided that if payment is not received from the credit card issuer, Customer agrees to pay all amounts due upon demand. Customer must provide current, complete and accurate billing and credit card information. Customer agrees to pay all costs of collection, including attorney’s fees and costs, on any outstanding balance. In certain instances, the issuer of the credit card may charge a foreign transaction fee or related charges, which Customer shall be responsible to pay. In certain instances, the issuer of the credit card may charge a foreign transaction fee or related charges, which Customer shall be responsible to pay.

Customer will be responsible for payment of any applicable sales, use and other taxes and all applicable export and import fees, customs duties and similar charges (other than taxes based on Embrace’s income), and any related penalties and interest for the grant of access rights hereunder, or the delivery of related services. Customer will make all required payments to Embrace free and clear of, and without reduction for, any withholding taxes. Any such taxes imposed on payments to Embrace will be Customer’s sole responsibility, and Customer will, upon Embrace’s request, provide Embrace with official receipts issued by appropriate taxing authorities, or such other evidence as Embrace may reasonably request, to establish that such taxes have been paid. Customer’s billing address will be used to determine the appropriate taxing jurisdiction of the Application Services purchased.

## Access to the Services

Embrace does not provide the equipment required to access the Application Services. Customer is responsible for all fees charged by third parties related to Customer’s access and use of the Application Services (e.g., charges by Internet service providers). In the event Customer utilizes SMS notifications as part of its utilization of the Application Services, Embrace reserves the right to pass through its costs of such service to Customer, and Customer agrees to pay such fees.

Embrace also reserves the right to restrict, suspend, or terminate access to the Application Services at any time, if in Embrace’s sole determination, Customer is using the Application Services in a manner that violates applicable laws or the terms of this Agreement, fails to make payment to Embrace or creates an Excess Burden on Embrace’s systems. “Excess Burden” means when the Application Services are being used to engage in denial of service attacks, spamming, or any illegal activity, and/or use of Application Services is causing immediate, material and ongoing harm to Embrace or Embrace’s other customers.

Embrace does not provide maintenance for, or guarantee the continued function of, the Application Services. Embrace reserves the right to change, discontinue, delete and/or deprecate, at any time and at Embrace’s sole discretion, any product feature, support service and any custom report template that may be made available to or accessible by Customer, including through the Application Services. Custom reports could include, but are not limited to, any reports customized for Customer’s use.

From time to time, Embrace may make Beta Services (as defined below) available to Customer at no charge. Customer may choose to utilize such Beta Services in Customer’s sole discretion. Beta Services are intended for evaluation purposes and not for production use, are not fully supported and may be subject to additional terms that may be presented to Customer. Beta Services are provided on an “as-is” and “as available” basis without any warranty, support, maintenance, storage, service-level agreement or indemnity obligation of any kind and so, are not considered “Application Services” hereunder, even if displayed in the user interface; however, all restrictions herein, Embrace’s reservation of rights and Customer’s obligations concerning the Application Services shall apply equally to Embrace’s use of Beta Services. Embrace may discontinue Beta Services at any time in its sole discretion and may never make them generally available. Embrace will have no liability for any harm or damage arising out of or in connection with a Beta Service. “Beta Services” means a product, service or functionality provided by Embrace that may be made available to Customer to try at Customer’s option at no additional charge which is clearly designated as beta, pilot, limited release, non-production, early access, evaluation or by a similar description. Beta Services may be considered Confidential Information of Embrace, if so denoted or communicated by Embrace to Customer. Customer will not disclose (including, but not limited to, in a press release or public statement) any information about, involving or regarding Beta Services (including the existence of), except as agreed by Embrace in writing.

## Restrictions

Customer shall use the Application Services only in compliance with all applicable laws, including any applicable privacy laws, and the terms of this Agreement. Customer shall not and shall not permit or authorize any third party to: (i) store, copy, modify, distribute, or resell any of the information; audio, visual, and audiovisual works, or other content made available on the Application Services, or compile or collect any such content as part of a database or other work; (ii) use any automated tool (e.g., robots, spiders) to access or use the Application Services; (iii) rent, lease, or sublicense Customer’s access to the Application Services to another person; (iv) use any Application Services for any purpose except for Customer’s own internal use; (v) circumvent or disable any digital rights management, usage rules, or other security features of the Application Services; (vi) use the Application Services in a manner that overburdens, or that threatens the integrity, performance, or availability of, the Application Services; or (vii) remove, alter, or obscure any proprietary notices (including copyright and trademark notices) on any portion of the Application Services.

## Data

The Application Services are designed to allow Customer to learn how Customer’s customers, users and other individuals (“Authorized Users”) use Customer’s mobile applications or mobile websites by giving Customer the ability to collect information and data (collectively, “Customer Content”) based on their interaction with Customer’s mobile applications or mobile websites where Customer has integrated the Application Services and sent communications to them. Some information is automatically collected from or about Authorized Users when Customer uses the Application Services. If Customer integrates an official Embrace iOS, Android, or other library in Customer’s mobile applications or mobile websites, it may by default collect Customer Content including but not limited to: the time of an event, the elements an Authorized User has interacted with, metadata and other details about these elements including duration of interaction, information about the device an Authorized User is on such as their operating system and browser, as well as the city/country location of Authorized Users. In addition, Customer can choose what other Customer Content Customer wants to collect such as IP addresses, user names, email addresses and other custom properties.

USE OF THE APPLICATION SERVICES DOES NOT REQUIRE COLLECTION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION.

“Personal Data” means any Customer Content voluntarily provided by Customer to Embrace and processed by Embrace relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, identification number, location data, online identifier or to one or more factors specific to physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural, or social identify of that natural person. To the extent Customer Content that includes Personal Data is sent by Customer through the Application Services and Customer’s use of the Application Services involves the processing of Personal Data, Embrace’s Data Processing Addendum available at Data Processing Addendum shall govern such processing. Under no circumstances will Embrace be deemed a “data controller, a “business”, or similar entity under applicable laws with respect to Customer Content under applicable data protection laws.

Customer agrees to comply with all applicable privacy and data protection regulations. Further, Customer agrees to not use the Application Services to send Embrace sensitive information where unauthorized disclosure could cause material, severe, or catastrophic harm or impact to Embrace, any data subjects or third parties. Sensitive Information includes, but is not limited to: Passwords, authentication/authorization credentials; Information under heightened regulatory or contractual handling requirements (e.g., PCI, HIPAA, FCRA); Credit card information including credit card numbers; CIV numbers (three digit codes for Visa and MasterCard, four digit code for American Express) and magnetic stripe information; Social Security Numbers; Driver’s License Numbers; Passport Numbers; Government Issued Identification Numbers; Financial Account Information; Health data; Biometric data; Personally identifiable information about children under the age of 13 or from online services directed toward children; Real time geolocation data which can identify an individual; or Business secrets deemed highly confidential (e.g., highly-confidential business strategies and communications, sensitive attorney-client privileged and confidential communications).

Use of the Application Services does not require collection of Personal Data. Personal Data may not be transmitted to Embrace absent prior written approval from Embrace. Embrace collects, stores, uses and accesses Customer Content to maintain, improve and support the Application Services. Embrace may also use Customer Content in an anonymized and aggregated form (“Aggregated Data”) for Embrace’s own business purposes, including use, duplication, modification and creation of derivative works regarding usage and performance of Aggregated Data which does not directly or indirectly identify Customer or their end users. Embrace shall own all right, title and interest to the Aggregated Data and any derivative works thereof.

Embrace provides Customer with access to Customer Content and ability to delete Customer Content upon request. Upon cessation of Embrace’s relationship with Customer, Embrace may delete Customer Content no longer in active use. Embrace agrees to maintain commercially reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to safeguard Customer Content from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Embrace takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any Customer Content other than its express security obligations in the Data Processing Addendum.

Embrace may also collect registration and other information about Customer as Embrace’s customer through Embrace’s website. Embrace’s collection and use of information collected about Customer on Embrace’s website is governed by the Embrace Privacy Policy. The Embrace Privacy Policy does not cover information Embrace collects on Customer’s behalf from Customer’s mobile properties. It is Customer’s obligation to provide Customer’s own privacy policy or notice to Customer’s users. An Authorized User may contact Embrace regarding Personal Data collected or processed, or may make requests within the Authorized User’s rights connected to consent, the right to erasure, the right to be forgotten, the right to object, or any other rights afforded by the GDPR. If such request is made directly to Embrace, Embrace will promptly and within a reasonable time frame, notify Customer and subsequently perform Authorized User’s request.

Customer agrees to provide appropriate notice(s) to and obtain affirmative consent from Authorized Users about Customer’s Personal Data collection and processing in accordance with this Agreement.

## Restricted Areas of the Services

Certain parts of the Application Services, including account management features, may be password-restricted to registered users or other authorized persons (“Password-Protected Areas”). If Customer is authorized to gain access to any Password-Protected Areas, Customer agrees that Customer is entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of Customer’s password, and agrees to notify Embrace if the password is lost, stolen, disclosed to an unauthorized third party, or otherwise may have been compromised. Customer agrees that Customer is entirely responsible for any and all activities that occur under Customer’s account, whether or not Customer undertakes such activities. Customer agrees to immediately notify Embrace of any unauthorized use of Customer’s account or any other breach of security in relation to Customer’s password or the Application Services that is known to Customer.
