# Honeycomb Integration

## Prerequisites

- Have an active Honeycomb account and an environment created.

## Pulling your Honeycomb API Key ([Honeycomb documentation](https://docs.honeycomb.io/working-with-your-data/settings/api-keys/))

1. Log into your Honeycomb account.
2. Locate your Environmentâ€™s API Keys:

In the left navigation bar under the Honeycomb logo, select the Environments banner. A menu appears with Manage Environments and a list of existing Environments.
