The API Tokens tab displays all API tokens associated with your organization. It provides a table listing each tokenâ€™s name and value, with special handling for default tokens.

Developers use this tab to:

- **Retrieve API Tokens:** Copy tokens for integrating Embrace with CI/CD, symbol upload scripts, or backend services.
- **Understand Token Purpose:** Tooltips and naming conventions clarify which token to use for metrics ingestion vs. symbol uploads.
- **Audit Token Access:** See which tokens are available and which are restricted, supporting security best practices.
