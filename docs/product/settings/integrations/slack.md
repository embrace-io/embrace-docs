# Slack

The Slack tab manages your organizationâ€™s Slack integration for alerting and notifications.

Developers use this tab to:

- **Manage Slack Destinations:** Add or remove Slack channels for organization-wide notifications.
- **Control Alert Routing:** Ensure only relevant channels receive alerts by updating the list as team structures or notification needs change.
- **Integrate with Slack:** Quickly connect Embrace to Slack without manual webhook setup, streamlining alert delivery.
