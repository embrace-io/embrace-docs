# Settings

The settings page in the Embrace dashboard centralizes configuration and management for your organization and apps. It enables developers to control integrations, notification preferences, API access, and other operational parameters.

Developers use the settings page to:

- Integrate Embrace with external systems (Slack, webhooks, CI/CD).
- Customize notification workflows to reduce noise and ensure relevant alerts.
- Securely manage API credentials for backend and build pipeline integrations.
- Audit and update notification and integration endpoints as team or app requirements evolve.
