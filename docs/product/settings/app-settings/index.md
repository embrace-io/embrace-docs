The App Settings page in the Embrace dashboard centralizes configuration and management for each monitored app. It exposes platform-specific and cross-platform controls that directly affect data collection, symbolication, alerting, and integrations.

Key tabs and their functions:

- [**Version Picker:**](/product/settings/app-settings/version-picker.md) Set the “latest” release, hide versions, and configure top version thresholds for analytics and alerting.
- [**Data Usage:**](/product/settings/app-settings/data-usage.md) Control sampling rates globally and per-version; manage iOS WebView log collection.
- [**Network:**](/product/settings/app-settings/network.md) Define first-party domains and grouping rules for network monitoring.
- [**Artifact uploads:**](/product/settings/app-settings/dsym-symbols.md) Upload and audit symbol files (dSYMs for iOS, Proguard/NDK for Android, Source Maps for JS/Web) to enable stack trace symbolication.
