# Error logs

The Error logs page in the Embrace dashboard provides a centralized view of all error logs emitted by your application, with a focus on error-level logs.

## Page details

Key information on the Error logs page includes:

- **Aggregated Logs:** Groups logs by wildcarded message patterns, showing severity, event count, trends, affected devices, user percentage, and app versions. Useful for spotting recurring issues and trends.
- **Raw Logs:** Displays every individual log entry in real time, including severity, timestamp, device model, and raw message. Expanding a log reveals properties and stack traces.
- **Advanced Filtering:** Filter logs by app, user, device, OS, session, severity, and more. Free-text search and saved filter combinations accelerate investigation.
- **Log Details:** For each log group, view total events, trends, affected devices/users, and distribution across app versions.
- **Affected Sessions:** See recent sessions containing a specific log, with stack traces and the ability to jump into the full session timeline for context.
- **Log Stats:** Pivot log distribution by device, OS version, country, and session properties, highlighting anomalies (e.g., logs occurring more than expected on certain devices).
