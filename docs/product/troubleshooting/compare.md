# Compare issues

The Compare page in the Embrace dashboard is a critical tool for release monitoring, regression detection, and prioritizing engineering work based on real-world impact.

The Compare page enables developers to select and compare up to three app versions side-by-side to analyze stability, performance, and adoption trends across releases.

## Important information on Compare

Some key information on the Compare page:
- **Session Outcomes:** Percentage of sessions without crash, force quit, ANR, or OOM, and breakdowns for each outcome type (e.g., crash rate, force quit rate).
- **Health Indicators:** Metrics like low memory warnings, CPU pegged time, average session length, and ANR intervals, shown per version.
- **Benchmarks:** Comparison of your app’s metrics against industry benchmarks or other apps.
- **Adoption Trends:** Visualizations of session counts and adoption rates for each selected version.
- **Performance Metrics:** Success rates and durations for key app moments, highlighting regressions or improvements.
- **Version Contribution:** Each version’s impact on overall app health and user experience.
