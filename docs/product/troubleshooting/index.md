Embrace allows developers to find the root cause of production issues in their apps. However, as most developers know, there can be many kinds of issues in user-facing applications, which makes troubleshooting difficult.

The dashboard places problems in context of the specific user's session, then aggregates them to let developers triage and prioritize issues before solving them. These troubleshooting mechanisms include:

- [Crashes](/docs/product/crashes/), a prominent source of user frustration.
- [Error Logs](/docs/product/troubleshooting/error-logs.md) point developers to severe issues.
- [ANR Reporting](/docs/product//troubleshooting/anr-reporting.md) point to Android apps "hanging" or not responding.
- [Release Health](/docs/product//troubleshooting/release-health.md) to measure rollout viability from one version to the next.
- [Compare Issues](/docs/product//troubleshooting/compare.md) lets you see how you've resolved issues before.
- [User Terminated](/docs/product//troubleshooting/user-termination.md) indicate user terminations.
- [Uncategorized Exit](/docs/product//troubleshooting/uncategorized-exit.md) indicate uncategorized exits.
- [Out of Memory](/docs/product//troubleshooting/out-of-memory.md) indicate out of memory issues.
