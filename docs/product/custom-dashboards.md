# Custom Dashboards

In addition to our pre-built dashboards for topics like Crashes, Logs, and Network Requests, each project can create Custom Dashboards.  In these dashboards, you can create new analyses.  Visualize a time series of Crash data segmented by app-version, or get a ranking of Logs filtered by a specific property.

To get started, click on "Add new widget" in the menu by your dashboard name.

## Spans (Traces)

Create graphs monitoring Spans performance.  You can filter and group by name, outcome, duration, and any attributes you have set on the Span.

First, select the Spans category when making a new Widget:
<img src={require('@site/static/images/Spans widgets > 02 pick Spans.png').default} alt="Spans as a Widget option" />

Then, choose the metric you wish to aggregate.  For Spans, Embrace supports both counts and sums of duration.

Finally, add any filters and group-bys.  In addition to our core dimensions, for Spans you can use the Span's name, outcome, duration, and any custom Attributes.

## Table of Issues

Our Issues Widget, lets you specify how to list a table of [Issues](/product/issue-monitoring-and-work-flow) .  You can filter for certain Issue types, add filters to limit app-versions, or select just Issues [tagged to your team.](/product/tagging)

To get started, click on the Issues category when making a new Widget:
<img src={require('@site/static/images/issues in dashboard.png').default} alt="Issues as a Widget option" />

Adjust the columns you want to display and how to filter the Issues
<img src={require('@site/static/images/issues widget filter.png').default} alt="customize your Issues list" />

Then once you save, you'll see this table on your dashboard!  Issues are sorted by percentage of users impacted:
