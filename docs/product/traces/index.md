# Getting Started

## Improve performance with Traces

Embrace’s Traces give you visibility into any key user flow or app operation that you’d like to track. 

This rich [OpenTelemetry signal](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/traces/) lets you include duration, success rate, and any contextual metadata from the app's runtime to debug the root cause of your app's performance issues. With Traces, you can quickly spot any bottlenecks in your app’s architecture, pinpoint with high precision the areas you need to troubleshoot, and ultimately deliver a truly optimized user experience.

## How Traces work

Traces are added to key flows in your app using the Embrace SDKs. Once you've begun to find user activity, you can make sense of the

- [Traces in the Dashboard](/docs/product/traces/traces-ui.md): How to measure performance in the Traces page
- [Exporting Traces](/docs/product/traces/exporting-traces.md): How to export Traces to other platforms.

To add Traces to your application, use the detailed instrumentation instructions by platform:

- [iOS](/docs/ios/open-source/features/traces.md)
- [React Native](/docs/react-native/features/traces.md)
- [Unity](/docs/unity/features/traces.md)
- [Flutter](/docs/flutter/features/traces.md)
