# Exporting Traces

## Exporting Traces via Data Destinations

Spans for Network requests can be exported as part of [Network Span Forwarding](/product/network-spans-forwarding.md).

## Exporting Traces to OpenTelemetry Collectors

Embrace's SDKs can export traces to any [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) directly from an app using a [SpanExporter](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/trace/sdk/#span-exporter).
For more details, see [Export to OpenTelemetery Collectors](/open-telemetry/integration.md#export-to-opentelemetry-collectors)
