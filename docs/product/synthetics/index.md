## Browser testing to evaluate baseline performance across pages and competitors 

Web Synthetic Monitoring with Embrace

Embrace’s Synthetic Monitoring enables developers to continuously measure the performance of key pages and transactions under controlled, repeatable conditions. Synthetic tests provide baseline performance visibility, support monitoring of competitor sites, and enable validation of experiments running in production, helping teams understand performance changes independent of real user traffic variability.

By executing scheduled tests across regions, browsers, and device profiles, Embrace surfaces industry standard Core Web Vitals and other metrics including but not limited to TTFB, FCP, LCP, TBT, and CLS. These metrics make it possible to detect regressions early, validate performance expectations, and identify rendering or execution bottlenecks before they impact real users. Synthetic monitoring complements real user monitoring (RUM) by providing deterministic signals that are especially valuable for release validation, experimentation, and monitoring critical flows.
