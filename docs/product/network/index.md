# Getting Started

Make sense of all your application's requests with the Networking page. 

## Implementation

Embrace's SDKs provide automatic tracking of all network requests. 

In the dashboard, developers can see a comprehensive view of network requests, allowing them to assess the performance of each request and its impact on your users. Developers can:

- [Monitor Network Calls](/docs/product/network/network-monitoring.md).
- [Group Network Requests by Path](/docs/product/network/network-grouping-rules.md) to dig deeper into correlated issues.
