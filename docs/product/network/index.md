# Getting Started

Make sense of all your application's requests with the Networking page.

## Implementation

Embrace's SDKs provide automatic tracking of all network requests.

In the dashboard, developers can see a comprehensive view of network requests, allowing them to assess the performance of each request and its impact on your users. Developers can:

- [Monitor network calls](/product/network/network-monitoring.md).
- [Group network requests by path](/product/network/network-grouping-rules.md) to dig deeper into correlated issues.
- [Enable first-party domains](/docs/product/settings/app-settings/network.md) to prioritize requests to known sources, such as your app's backend.
