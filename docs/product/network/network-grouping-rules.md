# Network Grouping Rules

Embrace provides automatic collapsing of network paths to group similar paths together for analytics purposes.
We automatically collapse certain path elements if they match a common pattern, and we also group endpoints
that have a similar prefix. This heuristic can be good enough for most cases, but sometimes it is necessary
to override the behavior.

On the network settings page you can specify a list of desired groupings (or network grouping rules) that you want to
apply to your endpoints. When we process a network request, we apply all the network grouping rules in sequence, where
the first|last match wins.

Custom rules are applied on the backend on a going forward basis.

# Rules Reference

We currently provide the following patterns:

* `«wildcard»` - Matches any single path segment
* `«**»` - Matches any number of path segments
* `«ext:file_extension»` - Matches a string ending with a period and a 2 to 5 character extension.

# Sample Use Cases

### Collapsing High Cardinality Fields
If you have an endpoint with a high cardinality field, such as a UUID, you may want to collapse all requests to that
endpoint into a single group. You can achieve this by using the `«wildcard»` rule to collapse all the requests into a 
single group.

```shell
my.api.domain/v1/users/«wildcard»/messages
```

This will collapse the following requests:

```shell
my.api.domain/v1/users/1234bcdd/messages
my.api.domain/v1/users/user@mail.com/messages
my.api.domain/v1/users/test-user/messages
```

### Preventing Collapsing of Specific Endpoints
You may have a specific endpoint that you do not want to collapse at all. In our previous example we may not want to
collapse the `test-user` endpoint since we use that for testing purposes. We can achieve this by adding a rule that
exactly matches the endpoint and placing it after the wildcard rule.

```
my.api.domain/v1/users/«wildcard»/messages
my.api.domain/v1/users/test-user/messages
```

Since the last rule wins, this setup will collapse all endpoints except for the `test-user` endpoint.


### Collapse CDN Images
You can collapse endpoints for third-party SDKs into a single groups. For example, CDNs will have a large number of
path segments with a common prefix. 

```shell
my.cdn.domain/images/0x0/b/d/123x123/bd1234c-cb6f-4c9f-9df6-6787903c5442/file.jpg
my.cdn.domain/images/0x0/b/d/123x123/bd1234c-cb6f-4c9f-9df6-6787903c5442/image.jpg
my.cdn.domain/images/0x0/b/d/123x123/afcd333-4c9f-9df6-6787903c5442/splash.jpg
my.cdn.domain/images/icons/badge.jpg
```

You can collapse all the requests to the CDN into a single group by using the
`«**»` rule and an extension rule `«ext:jpg»`. Here's the new rule:

```
my.cdn.domain/images/«**»/«ext:jpg»
```
