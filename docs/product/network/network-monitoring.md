# Network Monitoring

## Network Summary

The Network Summary dashboard offers a high-level overview of your network requests. You can view the number of requests, average duration, and error counts grouped by 4xx and 5xx status codes. These metrics are also grouped by app version, enabling you to track changes in network performance over time with your releases. Use the filters to analyze network performance based on specific domains, countries, personas, and more.

### Endpoints List

This table presents a comprehensive list of all your network requests, organized by method, domain, and path. For each endpoint, you can view the average duration, number of requests, median duration, and error percentage. The table is sortable by each column, allowing you to quickly identify the slowest endpoints or those with the highest error rates. Use the search bar to locate specific endpoints efficiently.
