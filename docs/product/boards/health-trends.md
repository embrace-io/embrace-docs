# Health and Trends Board

The Health and Trends board is a pre-built template that reflects Standard Metrics, which provide an overall sense of app health. You can use this board to monitor users, crashes, and session activity out of the box.

To get started, click **Duplicate board** in the menu by your board name. Once you duplicate the board, you can customize it to fit your monitoring needs by adding or removing widgets, adjusting time ranges, and configuring filters.
