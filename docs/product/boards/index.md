# Dashboards

Embrace's boards allow you to turn any app information into a visualization. Using a combination of pre-built boards for common topics like Crashes and Networking, developers can create boards to further analyze what was happening to users.

## Details

From the Embrace dashboard, you can query, filter, group, and scale information that you receive from mobile clients in order to form useful visualizations.

Out of the box, Embrace offers certain "templated" boards, like **Daily New Users** or **Crash-Free Sessions**, that offer trends over time about the [health of your application](/product/boards/health-trends.md).

Additionally, you can create [custom boards](/product/boards/custom-dashboards.md) that arrange information in precisely the way you want to organize it. You can use these visualizations to dig into different attributes that affected the user in production.
