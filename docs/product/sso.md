# Single Sign On (SSO)

Embrace offers SSO support using standard SAML 2.0. Providers such as Okta, OneLogin, Google and Microsoft have been tested.

If you need assistance configuring SSO with other providers please [email us](mailto:support@embrace.io) or [Slack us](http://community.embrace.io/).

## Supported Features

- IdP-initiated flow - users navigate to your organization's SSO portal and select Embrace app.
- SP-initiated login - users enter their username on Embrace's dashboard and are redirected to your SSO portal for authorization.
- JIT provisioning (optional).

### IdP-initiated SSO

Users login into your Identity Provider's SSO page and then click the Embrace icon to automatically login to Embrace's dashboard.

### SP-initiated SSO

Users can start from Embrace's [dashboard](https://dash.embrace.io) by providing just their username (email) and completing authorization process via your Identity Provider.

- Click **Continue with SSO** on the bottom of the Embrace dashboard's ([dash.embrace.io](https://dash.embrace.io)) home page.
- Enter your email address.
- Optionally, check **Remember my email** box.
- Click **Log in using SSO** to be redirected to your SSO provider to complete authentication and be redirected back to Embrace.

## Configuring SAML 2.0 SSO

### Prerequisites

- Enterprise-level Embrace account with SSO feature enabled.
- Username and password for Embrace user with administrator access.

### Generic Configuration

In order to properly configure SAML SSO we'll need two pieces of information which you will need to obtain from SSO provider's portal:

1. **Metadata URL or XML File**: Some SSO providers referred to the Metadata URL as an "Issuer URL." Other providers might not use a URL and will only allow you to download an XML file.
2. **Domain**: In most cases, it will be the domain of your company's email (i.e. example.com if your email is bob.smith@example.com).

Once you have obtained those two pieces of information, any user with Embrace "admin" privileges can navigate to [dash.embrace.io](https://dash.embrace.io) SSO settings:

1. Click **Settings Page** (gear icon on the top right hand corner of the dashboard).
2. Select the **SSO** on the left.
3. On the **SSO Configuration**, choose `URL` and enter your **Metadata URL**, or choose `File` and upload your **Metadata XML File**.
4. Enter your company's **Domain**.
5. Select whether you wish to **Make SSO Optional** or not. You should keep this option turned `on` until you have fully verified that your SSO flow is working for all of your users. Afterwards, you can toggle this option to `off` to require SSO and disable email + password login process for all users.
5. Click **Save Changes**.

3. Navigate to to [dash.embrace.io](https://dash.embrace.io) SSO settings screen using any user wih Embrace "admin" privileges:
  - Click **Settings Page** (gear icon on the top right hand corner of the dashboard).
  - Select the **SSO** on the left.
  - On the **SSO Configuration**, choose `URL` and enter your **Metadata URL**.
  - Click **Save Changes**.
  - Navigate to **Provider Information** tab and copy your **Org ID**.
4. Within Okta's app configuration's **General Settings**, provide the **Org ID** obtained above; click Save.

### SP-initiated SSO

- Click **Continue with SSO**
- Enter your email address, and optionally, check **Remember my email** box.
