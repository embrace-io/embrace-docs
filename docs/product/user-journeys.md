# User Journeys

With Embrace's User Journeys feature, you can do more than just perform funnel analysis. User Journeys is designed to give you deeper insight into how performance affects user's and their behaviors.

**[PLACEHOLDER FOR SOME SPECIFIC EXAMPLE]**

## User Flows

User Flows are the grouping of events between two pieces of telemetry that you emit. You can create flows between any combination of the below events:

- Spans
- Network events
- Logs
- Breadcrumbs

For high cardinality fields such as Logs, Breadcrumbs, and Network, you can define events using wildcarding patterns. :> [!WARNING]
