Embrace's dashboard attempts to combine a user's activity into one cohesive picture of activity and intent using stitched sessions. 

After a user's session is ingested, it is sequenced, or "stitched", to previous sessions within a given time interval. This approach uses the user's device ID to tie together activity 

## Stitched Sessions List
The stitched sessions list presents a chronological compilation of all user sessions. Sessions are seamlessly stitched together to offer a complete view of the user's journey. You can easily identify sessions with crashes, ANRs (App Not Responding), or network issues, and filter them by user ID, device, app version, and more.
