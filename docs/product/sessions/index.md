# Get Total Insight into Activity with User Sessions

Embrace's Sessions allows developers to recreate user journeys with detailed data, helping identify and resolve issues efficiently.

User Sessions give you every technical detail for every session that users were in your app. User Sessions are crucial for modeling and debugging app behavior, as they capture everything a user does from app launch to termination, including user actions and technical events. 

## What is a User Session?

User Sessions are an encapsulation of all app activity a specific user had during one use of the app.
<!-- TODO Add details of what starts and ends a session. -->
<!-- TODO Add details of background sessions. -->

## Implementation details

Sessions are automatically collected by the Embrace SDKs, ingested by Embrace's backend, and displayed in the Embrace dashboard. Once Sessions have been collected, they can be used in the dashboard a variety of ways:

- [Stitched Sessions](/docs/product/sessions/stitched-sessions.md) let you see user activity over time for all users or specific cohorts of users.
- [User Timelines](/docs/product/sessions/user-timeline.md) let you dig into the experience for individual users.
- [Session Filters](/docs/product/sessions//filter-sessions.md) let you filter users into groups by experiments, real-world conditions, and any other dimensions you attach to users.
