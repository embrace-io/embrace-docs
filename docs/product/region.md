# Data Location

Embrace prioritizes data security and adheres to regional regulations. You have the flexibility to choose the data center where your application data is stored, either in the United States (US) or the European Union (EU). This choice is crucial for meeting legal and compliance requirements.

## Data Center Selection

Your choice of data center is not limited by your geographic location. You can choose to create an app with data hosted in either the EU or US region, regardless of where you, your systems, or your users reside. You are solely responsible for the selection of the appropriate processing and storage region based on any data localization or data sovereignty laws, regulations, and any other third-party legal requirements applicable to you.
Embrace offers all the same active products, features, support offerings, and performance levels in the EU region as what is offered in the US region.

## Requirements

Access to the Embrace EU region requires the latest versions of our SDKs.

Minimum SDK version required:
- iOS 6.x
- Android 7.x

## How to choose your region

You can choose your region when you create a new app. You can select the region from the dropdown menu on the app creation page. 
Embrace allows organizations with apps in different regions. You can create apps in both regions and switch between them as needed.
Once your app is created, you can not change the region. Existing customer data within an app cannot be transferred to a different region.

## Customers data and Account data

End users data is stored within the selected region. All other information, including account information (such as Terms of Service Agreement, billing, and internal monitoring) is hosted in the US region and replicated in the selected region.

## Verify your account is based in EU region

Use either of these options to verify whether your app's data is hosted in the expected data center, login to Embrace dashboard:

- Go to your app's settings page, and check the region displayed.
- Go to All Projects page, and check the region displayed next to your app.
- In any other page within your app, check the region displayed in the top left app selector.
