# Retrieve Session Metadata

The Embrace SDK provides several methods for retrieving metadata about the current session. Note that each of the
following methods should be called after the SDK has initialized in order for them to return valid data.

## Current Session ID

```javascript
import {getCurrentSessionId} from '@embrace-io/react-native';

getCurrentSessionId().then(sessionId=>{
    console.log("Embrace Session Id", sessionId)
})
```  

import GetSessionId from '@site/shared/get-session-id.md';

<GetSessionId hideHeader />

:::warning Important
If you call `getCurrentSessionId()` inside the `AppState change` listener; keep in mind that this is the moment when
the session is ending, and a new one is starting. Therefore, there is a high chance that you will get the session ID of
the session that is still ending. You might need to delay the call or obtain the session ID at any other point of the app
lifecycle to make sure the session ID you get is the one you are looking for.

## Last Run End State

```javascript
import {getLastRunEndState} from '@embrace-io/react-native';

getLastRunEndState().then(resp => {
  console.log('LastRunEndState', resp);
});
```

This API enables customers to automatically/programmatically understand if the previous app instance ended in a crash.
Depending on your use case, having the ability to query an API to understand if the previous app instance ended in a crash
will enable you to adjust the behavior or UI of your app after a crash has occurred.

**What do we mean by previous app instance?**  

A cold launch, basically. If the app gets backgrounded/resumed so a new session starts, the value returned will not change. So:

1. App crashes
2. App is relaunched
3. `getLastRunEndState` returns "crashed"
4. App is sent to background
5. App is resumed, starting a new session
6. `getLastRunEndState` still returns "crashed"
7. App exits cleanly
8. App is relaunched
9. `getLastRunEndState` returns "clean exit"

**Important Notes**

:::warning Important
- The API can only be called after the SDK has been started. If a call is made prior to starting the Embrace SDK you will get a response of `INVALID`
- It will return that a crash occurred if the app crashed any time since the app last came to the foreground. This includes if the app crashed while running in the background.

### Possible Values

```typescript
/// Used to represent the end state of the last run of the application.
export type SessionStatus = 'INVALID' | 'CRASH' | 'CLEAN_EXIT';
```

## Current Device ID

```javascript
import {getDeviceId} from '@embrace-io/react-native';

getDeviceId().then(deviceId=>{
    console.log("Embrace Device Id", deviceId)
})
```
