# React Native Feature Reference

Embrace's SDK includes many advanced features that you can enable to help you understand more about
how your application is performing in production.

- [**Know your users.**](/react-native/4x/features/identify-users/) Add your own custom identifiers to users and sessions to make sure you can aggregate and find sessions correctly.
- [**Tracking Components.**](/react-native/4x/features/tracking-components/) Track the mounting and unmounting of React Components for your React Native application using the Embrace SDK.
- [**Current Session ID API.**](/react-native/4x/features/current-session-id-api.md) This API lets you know what the current Session Id is in case you need to track it separately.
