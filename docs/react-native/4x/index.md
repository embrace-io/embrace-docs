## Getting Started

This documentation is split into two sections:

- [**Integration Guide**](/react-native/4x/integration/)
- [**Feature Reference**](/react-native/4x/features/)

If you are just starting out with Embrace, follow the [**Integration Guide**](/react-native/4x/integration/) to learn
the key steps to successfully using our product.

Once you've completed that, browse through our [**Feature Reference**](/react-native/4x/features/) guides to learn how
to use the advanced features our SDK provides.

You can also view our [Changelog](/react-native/changelog/).
