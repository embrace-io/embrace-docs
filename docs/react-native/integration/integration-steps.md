# Integration steps

1. [**Log in to the Embrace dashboard.**](/react-native/integration/login-embrace-dashboard) Your data is available in the dashboard. Keep this open while working on the integration to monitor progress.
   1. If you want to use the SDK without sending data to Embrace, see the [Use without an Embrace account](/react-native/integration/login-embrace-dashboard#use-without-an-embrace-account) section.
2. [**Add the Embrace SDK.**](/react-native/integration/add-embrace-sdk) Add the Embrace SDK to your project.
3. [**Upload symbol files.**](/react-native/integration/upload-symbol-files) Learn which files need to be uploaded to make sure stack traces are translated.
4. [**Create your first session.**](/react-native/integration/session-reporting) Launch your app after you've initialized Embrace and see your first session in the Embrace dashboard.
5. [**Collect your first crash report.**](/react-native/integration/crash-reporting) Generate a crash and see the report that gets uploaded.
6. [**Add a breadcrumb.**](/react-native/integration/breadcrumbs) Log messages using the Embrace SDK.
7. [**Add alerts.**](/react-native/integration/log-message-api) Use Embrace's log events to power a real-time alerting system so you can rest easy knowing Embrace will notify you if your application breaks.
