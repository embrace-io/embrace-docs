# React Native Integration

## Requirements

### Android

* Android: Android 7.0 (API 24)
* `minSdkVersion`: 24 or higher
* `compileSdkVersion`: 34 or higher
* Java 1.8
* Kotlin 1.4
* Gradle 7.5.1
* AGP (Android Gradle Build Tools Plugin) 7.2.2

### iOS

* iOS 13.0
* Swift 5
* Known incompatibilities
  * `@datadog/mobile-react-native`. More details [here](/ios/open-source/integration/linking-embrace/#known-issues).

### Expo

For Expo apps, the project must be ejected (use `expo eject` for older versions or `expo prebuild` for newer versions) to integrate the necessary native components.
