# React Native Integration

## Getting Started

This guide will walk you through integrating Embrace into your React Native application with a series of articles. We
recommend following them in order, although you are free to skip around.

## Requirements

:::info
Note that our minimum requirements on the native side tend to be a bit higher than those set by react-native init or
@react-native-community/cli init by default for a fresh React Native project, please double-check that your project is
configured correctly for the SDK to run. You may find [these app templates](https://github.com/embrace-io/embrace-react-native-sdk/tree/main/integration-tests/templates)
that we've setup for integration testing useful as a guide for bringing your project up to the minimum required
configuration.
:::

### Android

* Android: Android 7.0 (API 24)
* `minSdkVersion`: 24 or higher
* `compileSdkVersion`: 34 or higher
* Java 1.8
* Kotlin 1.8.22
* Gradle 7.5.1
* AGP (Android Gradle Build Tools Plugin) 7.4.2

### iOS

* iOS 13.0
* Swift 5
* Known incompatibilities
  * `@datadog/mobile-react-native`. More details [here](/ios/open-source/integration/linking-embrace/#known-issues).

### Supported versions of React Native

We test that apps integrated with Embrace across React Native minor versions from `0.71` to `0.79` build and launch without
issue. Apps on versions of React Native older than 0.71 may work with Embrace after some modification but these are not
directly supported. The templates used to generate apps for integration testing along with the exact patch versions of
React Native we use can be found [here](https://github.com/embrace-io/embrace-react-native-sdk/tree/main/integration-tests/templates).

### Expo

Apps using Expo should work with Embrace however setup of our SDK does require modification of files within your
project's native `android/` and `ios/` folders, as such those directories need to be created by running `expo prebuild`
(or equivalently for older versions the project must be ejected using `expo eject`).

We are developing an Expo Config plugin to better integrate with the framework, you can follow [this issue](https://github.com/embrace-io/embrace-react-native-sdk/issues/308)
to be notified of progress.
