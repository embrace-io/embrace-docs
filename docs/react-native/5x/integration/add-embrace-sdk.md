# Adding the React Native Embrace SDK

## Add the JavaScript library

Use Yarn or NPM to install the NPM module.

```shell-session
yarn add @embrace-io/react-native
```

```shell-session
npm install @embrace-io/react-native
```

:::info
If you are using a yarn workspace, you must run the command at the react-native application folder level or modify package.json manually. Do not run this on your yarn workspace root.
:::

For iOS you will also need to install the pod:

```shell
cd ios && pod install --repo-update
```

# Adding the SDK 

## Setup Script

The JavaScript Embrace SDK ships with a setup script to modify the files in your
project to add the native dependencies. The setup scripts can be found in your
`node_modules` folder at `node_modules/@embrace-io/dist/scripts/setup`

**Run the setup script**
```shell-session
node node_modules/@embrace-io/react-native/lib/scripts/setup/installAndroid.js
```

```shell-session
node node_modules/@embrace-io/react-native/lib/scripts/setup/installIos.js
```

:::info Clean Up Embrace implementation
If you need to clean up an Embrace implementation added manually or by our scripts you can use our uninstall script
```shell-session
node node_modules/@embrace-io/react-native/lib/scripts/setup/uninstall.js
```
:::

You can use git to see the changes that the script made.

```shell-session
git diff
```

Compare the changes to the manual setup step to verify the changes were made
correctly.

## Manually

<Tabs groupId="platform" queryString="platform">
<TabItem value="ios" label="iOS">

Configuration for iOS is handled in code when initializing the SDK which we will cover in the next step. The native module
should be setup using [Autolinking](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/blob/dec33cb945be548a0d30c2ea073493e253239850/docs/autolinking.md#platform-ios)
so you're good to go!
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="android" label="Android">

Update the `build.gradle` file (usually located at `<root>/android/build.gradle`) to include the Embrace Gradle Plugin.

```groovy
buildscript {
  repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    google()
  }
  dependencies {
    classpath "io.embrace:embrace-swazzler:${findProject(':embrace-io_react-native').properties['emb_android_sdk']}"
  }
}
```

Then, update the app `build.gradle` file (usually located at `<root>/android/app/build.gradle`).

```groovy
apply plugin: 'com.android.application'
apply plugin: 'embrace-swazzler'
repositories {
  mavenCentral()
  google()
}
```

:::warning Important
React Native 0.59.0 and later automatically adds the required `compileOptions` directive to the `android/app/build.gradle` file.
If you are using a version of React Native older than 0.59.0, or your project was created with a version older than 0.59.0, add the following to your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    // ...

    compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }
    // ...
}
```

:::

Now, add the Embrace config file at `android/app/src/main/embrace-config.json`, and add your API key and token.

```json
{
  "app_id": "xxxxx",
  "api_token": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
}
```

:::info
Your API ID and token are available on the Embrace dashboard.
:::

:::info
Youâ€™ll need to set the following permissions so the Embrace SDK can send events and monitor connectivity.

* `android.permission.INTERNET`
* `android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE`
:::

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

There's a little more configuration we have to do to set up the uploading of symbol files.
You'll be learning about that next.


## Troubleshooting

### ExpoModulesProvider error

If you encounter the following build error on iOS after running through our setup using an expo app:

> "Cannot find interface declaration for 'ModulesProvider', superclass of 'ExpoModulesProvider'"

Update your `AppDelegate.m|mm` file to include the following import, making sure it is added before your
`#import "ProjectName-Swift.h"` line:

```objective-c
#import "ExpoModulesCore-Swift.h"
```

See [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/17705) for more details.
