# Integration Steps

1. [**Login to the Embrace Dashboard.**](/react-native/5x/integration/login-embrace-dashboard) Your data is available in the dashboard. It is important that you have this open while working on the integration to monitor progress.
1. [**Adding the Embrace SDK.**](/react-native/5x/integration/add-embrace-sdk) We'll be adding the Embrace SDK to your project.
1. [**Upload Symbol Files**](/react-native/5x/integration/upload-symbol-files) Learn which files need to be uploaded to make sure stack traces are translated.
1. [**Create Your First Session.**](/react-native/5x/integration/session-reporting) You'll launch your app after you've
   initialized Embrace, and be able to see your first session in the Embrace
   Dashboard.
1. [**Collect Your First Crash Report.**](/react-native/5x/integration/crash-reporting) Generate a crash and see the report that
   gets uploaded.
1. [**Add a Breadcrumb.**](/react-native/5x/integration/breadcrumbs) Log messages using the Embrace SDK.
1. [**Add Alerts.**](/react-native/5x/integration/log-message-api) Use Embrace's Log Events to power a real-time alerting system so you can rest easy knowing we will tell you if your application breaks.
