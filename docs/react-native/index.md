# React Native Platform Documentation

## Getting Started

This documentation is split into two sections:

1. [**Integration Guide**](/react-native/integration/)
2. [**Feature Reference**](/react-native/features/)

If you are just starting out with Embrace, follow the [**Integration Guide**](/react-native/integration/) to learn
the key steps to successfully using our product.

Also, if you are starting a fresh React Native project, notice that setting up full support for Embrace’s SDK can require additional configuration beyond the standard setup provided by `react-native init` or `@react-native-community/cli init` on the native side, mostly related to upgrading the minimum versions required for the SDK to run.

Once you've completed that, browse through our [**Feature Reference**](/react-native/features/) guides to learn how
to use the advanced features our SDK provides.

You can also view our [Changelog](/react-native/changelog/)
