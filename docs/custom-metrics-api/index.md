# Embrace Custom Metrics API

The Embrace Custom Metrics API allows you to manage (create, get and delete) the custom metrics of your organization.

Any Custom Metrics you create are available via the [Metrics API](/embrace-api), which is a separate interface. These metrics can also be forwarded to your organization's [observability platform of choice](/data-destinations). You can follow [this guide](/embrace-api/code_samples) to see how to query custom metrics in the Metrics API.

## Prerequisites

- Embrace Custom Metrics API Token. This is a different token than the Metrics API token. Contact an Embrace onboarding specialist to get this token for your organization. Once you receive the token, you can proceed independently with creating custom metrics.

## API Endpoints

All the endpoints have the same authentication and authorization method, url and parameters. Use the Custom Metrics API token provided by an Embrace onboarding specialist to create custom metrics.
- `URL`: `https://api.embrace.io/custom-metrics`

### Request

Headers:
- `Authorization`: we are going to use a Bearer token to authorize and authenticate our requests. 
i.e.: `Authorization: Bearer 7bd49186fed24af699cf93069fc64f03`.

URL Params:
- `app_id`: application id in which we are going to manage the custom metrics. i.e.: `appID1`
- `custom_metric_name`: custom metric name that we use to identify it. i.e.: `my_custom_metric_name`

Body Params:
- `name`: name you want to provide this new metric i.e.: `my_custom_metric_name`
- `metric`: base Embrace metric this new metric will be built from. i.e.: `sessions_total`.
- `group_by`: list of group by that we are going to use to group the metric. It can be empty.
  i.e.: `["os_version", "app_version"]`.
- `filters` list of filters that we are going to apply on the metric. It can be empty. i.e.:
```json
{
  "op": "and",
  "children": [{"field_op": "eq", "key": "os_version", "val": "12"}]
}
```
- `time_granularity`: list of granularity that we are going to support on this metric. If it is empty, by default hourly
  is turned on. i.e.: `["five_minute", "hourly", "daily"]`
- `data_destination`: list of data destination to which we are going to send this metric. If it is empty, by default metrics_api
    is turned on. i.e.: `["metrics_api", "newrelic", "datadog", "grafana_cloud"]`

### Response

Body Params:
- `custom_metric_id`: the unique ID for the metric created. i.e.: `XZ5BDQk`

Status codes:
- `200`: request was successful and we return a body with new information.
- `204`: request was successful and we don't return a body.
- `400`: the url params and body were not correct.
- `403`: you don't have access to execute that operation.
- `404`: metric that you are trying to consume doesn't exist.
- `409`: metric that you are trying to create already exists.
- `500`: there was an internal error and you should retry later.

### Create custom metric

#### Request

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.embrace.io/custom-metrics/api/v1/app/appID1/custom-metrics' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer 1b6be81cd01c4b08833295efadccafdc' \
--data '{
    "name": "sessions_total_v1",
    "metric": "sessions_total",
    "group_by": ["app_version"],
    "filters": {"op":"and", "children":[{"field_op":"eq","key":"os_version","val":"12"}]},
    "time_granularity": ["five_minute", "hourly"],
    "data_destination": ["metrics_api", "newrelic"]
}'
```

#### Filter Parameter Examples

| Type     | Example                                                                                             |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| string   | `{"key": "app_version", "field_op": "eq", "val": "3.2.0"}`                                          |
| int      | `{"key": "os_major_version", "field_op": "gt", "val": 9}`                                           |
| boolean  | `{"key": "has_anr", "field_op": "eq", "val": true}`                                                 |
| range    | `{"key": "status_code", "field_op": "eq", "val": {"start": 400", "end": 499}}`                      |
| property | `{"key": "type", "field_op": "eq", "val": {"property_key": "k1", "property_values": ["v1", "v2"]}}` |

#### Using `duration_bucket` filters

For some custom metrics the API allows you to filter data based on the `duration_bucket` parameter, which categorizes data according to specific `duration` ranges. Each `duration_bucket` value corresponds to a specific range of `duration` values. Here's how it works:

| Duration Range                  | Duration Bucket |
|---------------------------------|-----------------|
| 0ms to 100ms                    | 0               |
| 100ms to 200ms                  | 100             |
| 200ms to 300ms                  | 200             |
| 300ms to 400ms                  | 300             |
| 400ms to 500ms                  | 400             |
| 500ms to 600ms                  | 500             |
| 600ms to 700ms                  | 600             |
| 700ms to 800ms                  | 700             |
| 800ms to 900ms                  | 800             |
| 900ms to 1000ms                 | 900             |
| 1000ms to 2000ms                | 1000            |
| 2000ms to 3000ms                | 2000            |
| 3000ms to 4000ms                | 3000            |
| 4000ms to 5000ms                | 4000            |
| 5000ms to 10000ms               | 5000            |
| 10000ms to 15000ms              | 10000           |
| Greater than 15000ms            | 15000           |


**Caution:** When filtering with conditions such as `duration_bucket` < 1100, please be aware that the behavior is based on the order of conditions and the first condition that matches.
In this case, if `duration_bucket` is less than 1100, it will match the condition `duration_bucket` < 1000, and the `duration` filter will be < 2000. Ensure that your conditions are structured to achieve your intended filtering accurately.

If you want to filter all durations less or equal than 999 you should create this filter:

```json
{
  "op": "and",
  "children": [{"key": "duration_bucket", "val": 999, "field_op": "lte"}]
}
```

### Get metrics and parameters supported
To determine which metrics and parameters are supported for creation using the API, you can utilize the following request:
#### Request
```bash
curl --location 'https://api.embrace.io/custom-metrics/api/v1/app/appID1/custom-metrics/parameters' \

:::info
1. Refer to this [page](/custom-metrics-api/supported_metrics) if you want to see supported metrics without using the API.
:::

#### Query Parameter
`name`: metric name you want to see the parameters supported. i.e.: `sessions_total`

Example URL:
```
https://api.embrace.io/custom-metrics/api/v1/app/appID1/custom-metrics/parameters?name=sessions_total
