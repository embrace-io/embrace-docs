# Custom Metrics  

Custom Metrics that you create in Embrace are available for use in Grafana.

To set up: follow [our instructions](/embrace-api/grafana_integrations/) for integrating Embrace's Metrics API as a data source in Grafana.

Thereafter, every Custom Metric you create will automatically be available when you use Grafana's "Explore Metrics" in the Visualization builder.

Names will only show up once data begins populating the metric.  This means there's a delay for 5-minute, hourly, and daily results to be aggregated.
