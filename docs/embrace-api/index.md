# Embrace Metrics API

The Embrace Metrics API allows you to query your metrics from Embrace using PromQL. The queryable information includes any Embrace-provided metrics as well as any [Custom Metrics](/custom-metrics-api/) you have created. To get started, take a look at [Grafana Integration guide](/embrace-api/grafana_integrations/) or the [code samples](/embrace-api/code_samples/).
