# Logs Forwarding

## What is Logs Forwarding?

Logs Forwarding enables you to stream all logs captured by the Embrace SDK directly to your observability platform in real-time. Instead of logs only being available in the Embrace dashboard, they can be sent to tools like Grafana Cloud, Datadog, Honeycomb, or any OpenTelemetry-compatible platform you already use.

This means you can:
- **See mobile logs alongside your backend logs** in a single unified view
- **Use your existing logging tools** and workflows for mobile app debugging
- **Build custom dashboards** that combine mobile and server-side telemetry
- **Leverage advanced querying** capabilities of your observability platform

Logs are exported using the [OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP)](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/protocol/).
