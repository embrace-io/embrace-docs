# Privacy Policy

_Last Updated: June 28, 2022_

This Privacy Policy explains how information is collected and utilized by Embrace Mobile, Inc. (“Embrace,” “Embrace.io,” “we,” or “us”). This Privacy Policy applies to the Embrace website at https://www.embrace.io and the Embrace services (“Services”).

## INFORMATION EMBRACE COLLECTS THROUGH YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE

### App Developer Information

Embrace collects personally identifiable information from you, such as your name and email address, when you sign up for our service or contact us. We also track the views and actions you take on our site in order to improve the service.

### End User Session Information

We may collect non-personally identifiable information regarding the behavior and usage patterns of users of mobile applications (“End Users”) published by our customers. By default, such information is only linked to a session but not linked to any personally identifiable information, such as a persistent device identifier or email.

### End User Personal Information

Our customers may optionally request personal information from End Users in order to use their mobile applications.  Such personally identifiable information may be included in the data sent to us and linked with end user session information. End Users should therefore review the privacy policies of the mobile applications they use to assess the security of any personally identifiable information they disclose. To the extent we do receive any personally identifiable information, we will maintain the confidentiality of such data.

### Cookies

We may use cookies and similar technologies (collectively, “cookies”) to access information when you sign in, store your preferences, to keep you logged in, and to store a limited amount of behavioral data. By using our services, you consent to the use of cookies. You can configure your browser to accept or reject these cookies and we will respect this decision.

## THE WAY EMBRACE USES INFORMATION

### Contact its Users

We may use your email address or other personally identifiable information to send commercial, administrative, customer support, or marketing messages.

### Improve Embrace or its Services

We use both your personally identifiable information and certain non-personally-identifiable information to improve the quality and design of Embrace and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing our users' preferences and trends. We use cookies, clear GIFs, and log file information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit embrace.io; (b) monitor the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns; and (c) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.

## WHEN EMBRACE DISCLOSES INFORMATION

### Provide Services

We provide personally identifiable information and non-personally-identifiable information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing such information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information in compliance with our privacy policy, and we use reasonable efforts to limit their use of such information and to use other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.

We will retain personal information we process on behalf of our customer for as long as needed to provide services to our customer. Embrace will retain this personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

### Legal Requests and Comply with State and Federal Laws

We may release personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws or respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant.

Embrace also reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information that Embrace believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms of Service, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend itself against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of Embrace.

### In the Event of Merger, Sale, or Bankruptcy

In the event that Embrace is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information we have collected from our users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors rights generally, we may not be able to control how your personal information is treated, transferred, or used.

With Your Consent We may share your personal information with third parties with your consent for the purposes that you consent to.

## YOUR CHOICES

You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information through Embrace or the Services, in which case Embrace may not be able to provide certain services to you.

You may update or correct your personal profile information and email preferences at any time by visiting your account profile page or requesting the change with an Embrace representative. In addition, you can request to access, correct, or delete your personal information by contacting Embrace at support@embrace.io.

## OUR COMMITMENT TO DATA SECURITY

Embrace uses commercially reasonable physical, administrative, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. However, Embrace cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Embrace and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, Embrace makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or administrative safeguards. If Embrace learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. Embrace may post a notice on Embrace.io if a security breach occurs.

## CALIFORNIAN DISCLOSURES

If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA") permits you to request that we disclose to you the following information covering the past twelve months: the categories of personal information we collected about you and the categories of sources from which we collected such personal information; the specific pieces of personal information we collected about you; the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling (if applicable) personal information about you; the categories of third parties with whom we shared personal information about you; the categories of personal information about you that we sold and the categories of third parties to whom we sold such personal information (if applicable); and the categories of personal information about you that we otherwise shared or disclosed, and the categories of third parties with whom we shared or disclosed such personal information (if applicable). Additionally, you may request that we delete personal information we have collected from you as defined under the CCPA.

You can use the tools described in "Your Choices" or email us at support@embrace.com to exercise your rights under the CCPA. You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. Depending on your request, we may ask you to take steps to verify your identity, such as by texting us from the phone number you used when signing up and/or providing additional information. We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights and choices. If we receive your request from an authorized agent purporting to act on your behalf, we will ask the agent to provide proof that it has valid written authority to submit requests on your behalf, and we may ask you to verify your identity directly with us and to confirm that you provided such agent with power of attorney.

As defined in Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.14, we collect identifiers, commercial and financial information (for billing our Customers), internet and other network activity information, geolocation information, and inferences from the above-listed information. We don’t sell personal information to third parties. We may disclose such information for a "business purpose”, such as debugging, auditing, and performing services. Some mobile and web browsers transmit "do-not-track” signals. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. We currently do not take action in response to these signals.

## EUROPEAN DISCLOSURES

If you are an individual in the European Economic Area, the UK, or Switzerland, please read this section, which provides additional information applicable to you. We collect and process information about you only where we have legal bases for doing so under applicable laws in your country. The legal bases depend on the services you use and how you use them.

This means we collect and use your information only where:

- we need it to provide you with our services consistent with our Terms, including to operate Community, provide customer support and personalized features, and to protect the safety and security of Community;
- it satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as for research and development, to promote Community and to protect our legal rights and interests;
- you give us consent to do so for a specific purpose;
- where the processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of an individual;
- the processing is necessary for the performance of a task;
- we need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation.

If you have consented to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place. If we are using your information because we or a third party have a legitimate interest to do so, you have the right to object to that use though, in some cases, this may mean no longer using Community.

When we share information of customers in the European Economic Area, the UK, or Switzerland, we make use of the European Commission-approved standard contractual data protection clauses (a copy of which can be obtained by emailing us), or other appropriate legal mechanisms to safeguard the transfer. Information will be retained only for so long as reasonably necessary for the purposes set out above, in accordance with applicable laws.

Individuals in the EEA, UK or Switzerland have the rights described above in the "Your Choices" section, and may exercise those rights by contacting us as provided in the "Your Choices" section. You may lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority if you believe our processing of your information is unlawful.
