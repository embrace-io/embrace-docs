# Integration Steps

Integrating any new SDK with your application may feel like a daunting task. We’ve designed our documentation to guide you through the process as painlessly as possible. Following these steps will ensure you have a solid foundation for monitoring your application in production.

Regardless of the path you choose, you will be performing the following common steps to complete your integration:

1. [**Link Embrace with your application.**](/unity/integration/linking-embrace) This is the basic technical process of getting the Embrace SDK linked with your application.
2. [**Configure the iOS platform.**](/unity/integration/configure-embrace-ios) The Embrace SDK requires setting a few basic configuration options in order to correctly build. Here you will configure the iOS platform.
3. [**Configure the Android platform.**](/unity/integration/configure-embrace-android) Here you will configure the Android platform.
4. [**Open and login to the Embrace Dashboard.**](/unity/integration/login-embrace-dashboard) Your data is available in the dashboard. It is important that you have this open while working on the integration to monitor your progress.
5. [**Create your first session.**](/unity/integration/session-reporting) This involves launching your application with Embrace linked, and verifying the data shown in the dashboard.
6. [**Collect your first crash report.**](/unity/integration/crash-report) Here you will use Embrace to generate an intentional crash in your application so you can learn how those reports are collected and displayed.
7. [**Add a breadcrumb.**](/unity/integration/breadcrumbs) Learn how logging works in Embrace and how to port any existing logs you may have to the Embrace SDK.
8. [**Add alerts.**](/unity/integration/log-message-api) Use Embrace’s Log Events to power a real-time alerting system so you can rest easy knowing we will tell you if anything in your application breaks.
