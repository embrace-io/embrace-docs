# Next Steps

## Wrapping Up

Congratulations on completing the Unity integration guide!

If you found anything confusing or have suggestions on improving the docs,
please don't hesitate to reach out to us at <support@embrace.io> or on Slack.

## Feature Reference

Embrace includes many optional advanced features that can help you figure out some of 
the most challenging issues. 

Depending on the platform you are targeting you may want to read one or both of these sections:

1. [iOS Feature Reference](/ios/features/)
1. [Android Feature Reference](/android/features/)

## Best Practices

We offer further guides in the [Best Practices](/best-practices/) section of the docs.
Be sure to check these out, as they'll help you make decisions that will allow you to make the most of Embrace.
