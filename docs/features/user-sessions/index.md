# Getting Started

## Get total insight into activity with User Sessions

Embrace's User Sessions allows developers to recreate user journeys with detailed data, helping identify and resolve issues efficiently.

User Sessions give you every technical detail for every session that users were in your app. User Sessions are crucial for modeling and debugging app behavior, as they capture everything a user does from app launch to termination, including user actions and technical events. 

## What is a User Session?

User Sessions are an encapsulation of all app activity a specific user had during one use of the app.

## Implementation details

Sessions are automatically collected by the Embrace SDKs and exported to the Embrace dashboard.
