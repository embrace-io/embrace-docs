# Release Health

The Release Health section is designed to help teams monitor and compare the quality of two different app versions over customizable time windows. It enables data-driven decisions during rollouts and helps you catch regressions early by surfacing critical metrics related to app stability and user experience.

Whether you're preparing a new release, analyzing a canary rollout, or comparing production versions, Release Health gives you both high-level indicators and granular breakdowns of app issues.

## What You Can Track

Release Health currently supports insights into the following issue types:

- Crashes
- ANRs
- Exceptions
- Error Logs

For each issue type, we provide:

- Overall Impact Metrics:
    * % of affected users
    * % of affected sessions
- Detailed Breakdown:
    * Impact per issue type
    * Comparison delta between selected versions

All metrics are computed as a comparison between two groups:

- Group A (New Release) â€“ the app version you're evaluating
- Group B (Baseline) â€“ the reference version you're comparing against

## How to use

### Set Filters

Select the app version and evaluation period for both **Group A** and **Group B**.  
A preview panel will display:

- **Session Volume**
- **App Adoption** (within the selected time window)

These help you evaluate whether the comparison is statistically meaningful.

Once you're satisfied with your selection, click **Apply** to load the metrics.

> ðŸ’¡ *You can rename the group labels to something meaningful to your app or context.*

### Visualize Overall Metrics

- **Total Affected Users** â€“ percentage of users affected by any issue type, with comparison against Group B  
- **Total Affected Sessions** â€“ percentage of sessions affected by any issue type, with comparison against Group B

### Visualize Issue-Specific Metrics

- **Affected Users per Issue** â€“ percentage of users impacted by a specific issue type (Crashes, ANRs, etc.), compared to Group B  
- **Affected Sessions per Issue** â€“ percentage of sessions impacted by a specific issue type, compared to Group B

### Detailed Comparison

A detailed table listing each individual issue (e.g., specific crash or exception), with impact metrics across both groups. This helps you:

- Identify new or regressed issues in Group A
- Quantify the impact of each issue type
- Prioritize based on user/session impact delta between versions
