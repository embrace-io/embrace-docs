# User Session Insights
Experience every user interaction with real production-level data seamlessly. Embrace captures every user interaction, network request, and crash in real-time, providing you with comprehensive insights into your users' experiences.

## Stitched Sessions List
The stitched sessions list presents a chronological compilation of all user sessions. Sessions are seamlessly stitched together to offer a complete view of the user's journey. You can easily identify sessions with crashes, ANRs (App Not Responding), or network issues, and filter them by user ID, device, app version, and more.
