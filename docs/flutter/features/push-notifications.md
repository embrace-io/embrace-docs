# Push notifications

If using the [firebase_messaging](https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_messaging) package, push notifications received by your app can be automatically captured by Embrace. This behavior is disabled by default; it must be configured separately for the Embrace Android SDK and the Embrace iOS SDK.

## Android configuration

To enable the push notifications capture, you must set `instrumentFirebaseMessaging` to true in the `app/build.gradle` file of your Android project.

```groovy
embrace {
    bytecodeInstrumentation {
        firebasePushNotificationsEnabled.set(true)
    }
}
```

:::info
If you want to capture data from inside the notifications then you can set the config `capture_fcm_pii_data` to `true` in your `embrace-config.json` file inside `sdk_config`. This value is false by default.
:::

## iOS configuration

Push notifications capture is controlled by supplying a `captureService` when initializing the iOS SDK. To enable this functionality, add the following to where Embrace is initialized in your `AppDelegate`:

```swift
let builder = CaptureServiceBuilder().addDefaults()
builder.add(.pushNotification())
let services = builder.build()

try Embrace
    .setup(
        options: Embrace.Options(
            appId: "", // Your app ID
            captureServices: services,
            crashReporter: EmbraceCrashReporter()
        )
    )
    .start()
```

## Manually logging push notifications

Push notifications can also be manually logged from the Flutter SDK. This could be useful when using packages other than `firebase_messaging` or just if automatic capture is disabled. To register a push notification call the following method:

```dart
  void logPushNotification(
    String? title,
    String? body, {
    String? subtitle,
    Int? badge,
    String? category,
    String? from,
    String? messageId,
    int priority = 0,
    bool hasNotification = false,
    bool hasData = false,
  });
```

The `title` and `body` parameters will be common to all push notifications. The parameters `subtitle`, `badge` and `category` are exclusive to iOS notifications, while the rest are exclusive are exclusive to Android notifications. The parameters `hasNotification` and `hasData` correspond to the FCM distinction between `notification` and `data` messages (as described in the [Firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/concept-options))
