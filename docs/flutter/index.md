# Flutter Platform Documentation

## Getting Started

This documentation is split into two sections:

- [**Integration Guide**](/flutter/integration/)
- [**Feature Reference**](/flutter/features/)

If you are just starting out with Embrace, follow the [**Integration Guide**](/flutter/integration/) to learn
the key steps to successfully using our product.

Once you've completed that, browse through our [**Feature Reference**](/flutter/features/) guides to learn how
to use some of the advanced features our SDK provides.

You can also view our [Changelog](/flutter/changelog/)
