description: Upload Sourcemaps files to symbolicate exceptions and logs from your Web app

## Setup

In order to view symbolicated stack traces for exceptions in Embrace you must first upload your bundle and sourcemap
files. You can do so using our CLI tool, if you haven't already you can install it using:

npm:

```sh
npm install --save-dev @embrace-io/web-cli
```

yarn:

```sh
yarn add -D @embrace-io/web-cli
```

You will also require a `Symbol Upload` API token. This can be found in your Embrace dashboard by going
to [Settings->API](https://dash.embrace.io/settings/organization/api).

Then hook the CLI into your build process and point it to your built bundle and sourcemaps in order to perform the
upload:

```sh
npx embrace-web-cli upload -a "YOUR_EMBRACE_APP_ID" -t "YOUR_EMBRACE_UPLOAD_API_TOKEN" -b "BUNDLE_PATH" -m "SOURCE_MAP_PATH"
```

Additionally, if your app version is only known at build-time you can include it in the same command to have it injected
into the bundle. If you follow this method do not also include appVersion when calling `initSDK` as that value will take
precedence:

```sh
npx embrace-web-cli upload --app-version "APP_VERSION" -a "YOUR_EMBRACE_APP_ID" -t "YOUR_EMBRACE_UPLOAD_API_TOKEN" -b "BUNDLE_PATH" -m "SOURCE_MAP_PATH"
```

:::info
We currently support symbolication of function names only when defined with the function keyword.
For functions assigned to constants, or variables, you will still see the unsymbolicated token.
Line and column numbers, along with file names, will always be symbolicated to the original source.

## When including the SDK from CDN

Our CLI looks for a special placeholder string to replace with the real ID of the uploaded bundle files. When our SDK is
not bundled with your code you will need to provide this placeholder string when initializing the sdk as in the
following example:

   ```javascript
   sdk.initSDK({
     appVersion: '0.0.1',
     templateBundleID: 'EmbIOBundleIDfd6996f1007b363f87a',
     /*...*/
   });
   ```

:::info
It is simplest to use this specific string since that is what our CLI tool will look for by default, however any 32
character string would be valid. If you do use another value make sure to specify it using the
`--template-bundle-id` flag when invoking `embrace-web-cli upload`
