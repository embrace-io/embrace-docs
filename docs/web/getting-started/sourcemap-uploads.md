# Setup

In order to view symbolicated stack traces for exceptions in Embrace you must first upload your bundle and sourcemap
files. You can do so using our CLI tool, if you haven't already you can install it using:

npm:

```sh
npm install --save-dev @embrace-io/web-cli
```

yarn:

```sh
yarn add -D @embrace-io/web-cli
```

You will also require a `Symbol Upload` API token. This can be found in your Embrace dashboard by going
to [Settings->API](https://dash.embrace.io/settings/organization/api).

Then hook the CLI into your build process and point it to your path where the built JS files live in order
to perform the upload:

```sh
npx embrace-web-cli upload -a "YOUR_EMBRACE_APP_ID" -t "YOUR_EMBRACE_UPLOAD_API_TOKEN" -p "JS_BUILD_PATH"
```

Additionally, if your app version is only known at build-time you can include it in the same command to have it injected
into the bundle. If you follow this method do not also include appVersion when calling `initSDK` as that value will take
precedence:

```sh
npx embrace-web-cli upload --app-version "APP_VERSION" -a "YOUR_EMBRACE_APP_ID" -t "YOUR_EMBRACE_UPLOAD_API_TOKEN" -p "JS_BUILD_PATH"
```

:::info
We currently support symbolication of function names only when defined with the function keyword.
For functions assigned to constants, or variables, you will still see the unsymbolicated token.
Line and column numbers, along with file names, will always be symbolicated to the original source.
