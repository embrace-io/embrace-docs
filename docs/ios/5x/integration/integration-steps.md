# Integration Steps

Getting started with Embrace is very easy. We’ve designed our documentation to guide you through the process. 
Following these simple steps will ensure you have a solid foundation for monitoring your application in production.

Regardless of the path you choose, you will be performing the following common
steps to complete your integration:

# Prerequisites

# Add Embrace to your project

1. [**Link Embrace with your application.**](/ios/5x/integration/linking-embrace) This is the basic technical process of getting the Embrace SDK linked with your application so you can use it.
