# Integration Steps

Getting started with Embrace is very easy. We’ve designed our documentation to guide you through the process. 
Following these simple steps will ensure you have a solid foundation for monitoring your application in production.

Regardless of the path you choose, you will be performing the following common
steps to complete your integration:

# Prerequisites

- [**Open and login to the Embrace Dashboard.**](/ios/5x/integration/login-embrace-dashboard) If you haven't got your App ID yet, register and follow the steps in order to get started.

# Add Embrace to your project

- [**Link Embrace with your application.**](/ios/5x/integration/linking-embrace) This is the basic technical process of getting the Embrace SDK linked with your application so you can use it.
- [**Create your first session.**](/ios/5x/integration/session-reporting) This involves launching your application with Embrace linked, and verifying the data shown in the dashboard.

# Prepare to receive crashes

- [**DSym Upload.**](/ios/5x/integration/dsym-upload) An important step to ensure Embrace can symbolicate addresses in your sessions.
- [**Collect your first crash report.**](/ios/5x/integration/crash-report) Here you will use Embrace to generate an intentional crash in your application so you can learn how those reports are collected and displayed.

# Expand your data collection

- [**Add a breadcrumb.**](/ios/5x/integration/breadcrumbs) Learn how logging works in Embrace and how to port any existing logs you may have to the Embrace SDK.
- [**Add Alerts.**](/ios/5x/integration/log-message-api) Use Embrace’s Log Events to power a real-time alerting system so you can rest easy knowing we will tell you if your application breaks.
