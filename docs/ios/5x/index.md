# Getting Started

Embrace's 5.x SDK supports both the iOS and the Apple TV platform from a common codebase. All of the API you can use on iOS, is also available on Apple TV. The 5.x SDK is built on Objective-C and is closed-source. It is no longer recommended for new and current users, who should upgrade to the [6.x SDK](/ios/6x/index.md).

This documentation is split into two sections:

- [Integration Guide](./integration/)
- [Feature Reference](./features/)

If you are just starting out with Embrace, follow the [**Integration Guide**](./integration/) to learn the key steps to successfully using our product.

Once you've completed that, browse through our [**Feature Reference**](./features/) guides to learn how to use some of the advanced features our SDK provides.

You can also view our [FAQ](/ios/faq/) and [Changelog](/ios/changelog/)
