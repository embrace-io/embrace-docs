# View Capture Service

The `ViewCaptureService` is in charge of automatically instrumenting `UIViewController` load and render times.
You can customize the service behavior by passing a custom `ViewCaptureService` when setting up the Embrace SDK:

```swift
let services = CaptureServiceBuilder()
    .add(.view(options: ViewCaptureService.Options(instrumentVisibility: true, instrumentFirstRender: true)))
    .addDefaults()
    .build()

try Embrace
    .setup(
        options: Embrace.Options(
            appId: "APPID",
            captureServices: services
            //...other options
        )
    )
    .start()
```

### Customization

The `EmbraceViewControllerCustomization` protocol allows you to customize `UIViewControllers` for Embrace capture at an individual level.

The `shouldCaptureViewInEmbrace` variable allows you to prevent the Embrace SDK from generating data for that `UIViewController`.

The `nameForViewControllerInEmbrace` variable allows you to customize the name for the screen (the class name is used by default).

### Screen visibility

This feature is enabled by setting `instrumentVisibility` to `true` in the `ViewCaptureService.Options`.
The service will generate spans that start when a `UIViewController` appears (`viewDidAppear`) and ends when it disappears (`viewDidDisappear`).

### Time to First Render

This feature is enabled by setting `instrumentFirstRender` to `true` in the `ViewCaptureService.Options`.

The service will generate spans that start when a `UIViewController` is loaded (`viewDidLoad`) and ends when it becomes visible for the first time (`viewDidAppear`).
The service will also generate child spans measuring several steps in the process: `viewDidLoad`, `viewWillAppear` and `viewDidAppear`.

:::info
If the `UIViewController` disappears before it finishes loading, the spans status will be set to `.error` with the `.userAbandon` code.

:::warning
If you're using the Embrace Dashboard with your app, you might need to contact an Embrace representative to enable this feature through the remote configuration.

If you're not using the Embrace Dashboard, you can enable this feature by passing a custom `EmbraceConfigurable` with `isUiLoadInstrumentationEnabled` set to true when [initializing the SDK](/ios/open-source/integration/embrace-options/).
:::

### Time to Interactive

This feature is enabled by setting `instrumentFirstRender` to `true` in the `ViewCaptureService.Options`, and making a `UIViewController` implement the `InteractableViewController` protocol.

The service will generate spans that start when a `UIViewController` is loaded (`viewDidLoad`) and ends when it is flagged as ready for interaction (`setInteractionReady()`).
If you implement this protocol in one of your `UIViewControllers`, you need to call `setInteractionReady()` when the screen is ready to be interacted by the user.

Example:
```swift
class MyViewController: UIViewController, InteractableViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        // some async operation
        MyDataFetcher.fetch { [weak self] data in
            self?.loadData(data)
            self?.setInteractionReady()
        }
    }
}
```

:::info
If the `UIViewController` disappears before it is flagged as ready for interaction, the spans status will be set to `.error` with the `.userAbandon` code.

### Custom child spans

When the first render instrumentation is enabled, you can also add custom child spans to the ones automatically generated by the service.
You'll need to implement the `InstrumentableViewController` protocol and use the `buildChildSpan` or `recordCompletedChildSpan` methods

Example:
```swift
class MyViewController: UIViewController, InstrumentableViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        let childSpan = buildChildSpan(name: "data-fetch").startSpan()

        // some async operation
        MyDataFetcher.fetch { [weak self] data in
            self?.loadData(data)
            childSpan.end()
        }
    }
}
