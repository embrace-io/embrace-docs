# Get Started With Embrace

Once the Embrace Apple SDK is integrated into your mobile app, you can begin to send mobile signals to the Embrace backend for analysis. This section contains information on what you can expect from our commercial product. These features, such as [session reporting](/ios/open-source/getting-started/session-reporting.md) are also available for open-source users, but without the visualization provided by the Embrace dashboard.

Read on to find out more about:

- Adding [crash reporters](/ios/open-source/getting-started/crash-report.md) to your app.
- Making sense of [sessions](/ios/open-source/getting-started/session-reporting.md) in your app.
- Symbolicating [crash reports and dSYMs](/ios/open-source/getting-started/symbolicating-crash-reports.md) in your app.

## Prerequisites

To link the SDK to your Embrace dashboard, you will need an App ID. Register your app to get an App ID by [logging in to your Embrace Dashboard](/ios/5x/integration/login-embrace-dashboard.md).
