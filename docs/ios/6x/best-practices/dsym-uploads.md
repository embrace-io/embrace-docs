# dSYM Upload Automation

For detailed information about automating dSYM uploads with CI systems, please refer to our dedicated guide:

[Automated Builds and dSYM Uploads](/ios/best-practices/ci-dsym-upload/)

The guide covers:

- Setting up artifact storage in various CI providers
- Finding and collecting dSYM files
- Creating automated scripts for dSYM collection
- Working with Xcode Cloud
- Manual and automated uploads

This is an essential best practice for ensuring proper symbolication of crash reports in the Embrace dashboard.
