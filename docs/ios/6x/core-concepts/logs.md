# Logs

Logs provide contextual information about your application's state and events that occur during a session. The Embrace SDK's logging capabilities help you track, troubleshoot, and receive alerts about important events.

## What are Logs?

In the Embrace SDK, logs are records of events with associated severity levels, timestamps, and optional attributes. They provide critical information that can help you understand:

- Error conditions
- Warning situations
- Important state changes
- Significant user actions
- System events

Logs are especially valuable for capturing information that requires immediate attention or for troubleshooting specific issues.

## When to Use Logs

While Embrace automatically captures sessions and their associated data, there are scenarios where you may want to add custom logs:

- Hunting difficult bugs
- Troubleshooting for high-value users
- Monitoring new version rollouts
- Tracking critical business events
- Capturing error conditions that need immediate attention

## Using the Log API

The Embrace SDK provides a simple API for logging messages:

<Tabs groupId="ios-language" queryString="ios-language">
<TabItem value="swift" label="Swift">

```swift
let attributes = ["property_a": "value_a", "property_b": "value_b"]
Embrace.client?.log(
    "Loading not finished in time.", // message
    severity: .warn,
    timestamp: Date.now,
    attributes: attributes
)
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The log method takes the following parameters:

1. **message**: A string representing the log message itself
2. **severity**: The [LogSeverity](https://github.com/embrace-io/embrace-apple-sdk/blob/main/Sources/EmbraceCommonInternal/Models/LogSeverity.swift) of the event (e.g., info, warn, error)
3. **timestamp**: When this log event occurred
4. **attributes**: A dictionary of key-value pairs for additional context and filtering

## Log Limits

Embrace enforces certain limits on logs:

- Maximum number of logs per session: 500
- Maximum size of logs: 10,000 bytes

If your application exceeds these limits, the newest logs will be kept and the oldest logs will be dropped.

## Log Batching

To optimize device and network performance, Embrace batches logs according to the following criteria:

- A maximum of **2 seconds** between logs: After receiving a log, we wait for 2 seconds. If no additional log arrives during that period, we send it to the backend.
- A maximum of **5 seconds** for batch lifetime: Log batches should not exist for more than 5 seconds.
- A maximum of **50 logs** per batch: This prevents issues with large batches.

## File Attachments with Logs

You can attach data to logs to provide more context for troubleshooting:

### Embrace-Hosted Attachments

```swift
let attributes = ["property_a": "value_a", "property_b": "value_b"]
Embrace.client?.log(
    "This is a log with an Embrace-hosted attachment", // message
    severity: .info,
    timestamp: Date.now,
    attachment: someData, // NSData/Data
    attributes: attributes
)
```

Limitations for Embrace-hosted attachments:
- Maximum of 5 attachments per session
- Maximum attachment size of 1 MiB (1048576 bytes)

### User-Hosted Attachments

If you need more attachments or larger files, you can host the attachments yourself and reference them:

```swift
let attributes = ["property_a": "value_a", "property_b": "value_b"]
Embrace.client?.log(
    "This is a log with a user-hosted attachment", // message
    severity: .info,
    timestamp: Date.now,
    attachmentId: attachmentId, // String
    attachmentUrl: attachmentUrl, // URL
    attributes: attributes
)
```

## Log Alerting

One of the most powerful features of Embrace logs is the ability to set up alerts based on log events. Using the Embrace Dashboard, you can configure email alerts to be sent to your team when certain thresholds are met.

For example, if you have a steady rate of 1% for a given log event, you can set a threshold to receive an alert if it rises significantly.

## Logs vs Other Concepts

- **Logs vs Traces**: While traces focus on performance and operation flow, logs provide contextual information about events and states
- **Logs vs Sessions**: Logs are events within a session that provide additional context
- **Logs vs Breadcrumbs**: Logs are more detailed and can trigger alerts, while breadcrumbs are simpler markers of user journey steps

## Best Practices

- **Be selective**: Excessive logging can impact performance and battery life
- **Use appropriate severity levels**: Reserve error and warning levels for actual problematic situations
- **Add meaningful attributes**: This helps with filtering and understanding context
- **Keep messages clear and concise**: This makes troubleshooting easier
- **Consider timing**: Use the timestamp parameter to accurately reflect when events actually occurred
- **Batch related logs**: Log related information together using consistent attribute keys
