# Introduction to Embrace iOS SDK 6.x

The Embrace 6.x Apple SDK is designed to provide first-class observability and diagnostic data collection to your mobile application. It supports multiple platforms including iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, macOS, and watchOS.

Embrace's 6.x SDK is open-source and can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/embrace-io/embrace-apple-sdk/). It has been designed so that any Apple developer can add the SDK to their app and transmit telemetry without using Embrace, or can use Embrace to gain the key mobile insights that we've cultivated in our [product](/product/index.md).

## What is the Embrace iOS SDK?

The Embrace iOS SDK helps you monitor your app's performance, reliability, and user experience with minimal setup. Built on OpenTelemetry standards, the SDK collects vital metrics, events, and errors through automatic and manual instrumentation options that help you:

- Understand and improve your app's performance
- Track and resolve crashes and errors
- Monitor user journeys and experience
- Gain visibility into network performance
- Identify and fix issues faster

Whether you're developing a new app or supporting an existing one, Embrace provides the tools to ensure your app delivers the best possible experience to your users.
